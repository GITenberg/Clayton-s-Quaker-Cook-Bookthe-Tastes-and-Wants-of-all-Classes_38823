<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>One of the sacred writers of the olden time is reported to have
said: "Of the making of many books, there is no end." This remark
will, to a great extent, apply to the number of works published
upon the all important subject of Cookery. The oft-repeated saying,
attributed to old sailors, that the Lord sends victuals, and the opposite
party, the cooks, is familiar to all.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the great number and variety of so-called cookbooks
extant, the author of this treatise on the culinary art, thoroughly
impressed with the belief that there is ample room for one more of a
thoroughly practical and every day life, common sense character&mdash;in
every way adapted to the wants of the community at large, and looking
especially to the preparation of healthful, palatable, appetizing and
nourishing food, both plain and elaborately compounded&mdash;and in the
preparation of which the very best, and, at the same time, the most
economical material is made use of, has ventured to present this new
candidate for the public approval. The preparation of this work
embodies the result of more than thirty years personal and practical
experience. The author taking nothing for granted, has thoroughly
tested the value and entire correctness of every direction he has given
in these pages. While carefully catering to the varied tastes of the
mass, everything of an unhealthful, deleterious, or even doubtful character,
has been carefully excluded; and all directions are given in the
plainest style, so as to be readily understood, and fully comprehended
by all classes of citizens.</p>

<p>The writer having been born and brought up on a farm, and being
in his younger days of a delicate constitution, instead of joining in
the rugged work of the field, remained at home to aid and assist his
mother in the culinary labors of the household. It was in this home-school&mdash;in
its way one of the best in the world, that he acquired not
only a practical knowledge of what he desires to fully impart to others,
but a taste for the preparation, in its most attractive forms, of every
variety of palatable and health-giving food. It was his early training
in this homely school that induced him to make this highly important
matter an all-absorbing theme and the subject of his entire life study.
His governing rule in this department has ever been the injunction
laid down by the chief of the Apostles: "Try all things; prove all
things; and hold fast that which is good."</p>




<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY" id="INTRODUCTORY"></a>INTRODUCTORY.</h2>


<hr class="chap" />
<h3>A Brief History of the Culinary Art, and its Principal Methods.</h3>

<p>Cooking is defined to be the art of dressing, compounding and
preparing food by the aid of heat. Ancient writers upon the subject
are of opinion that the practice of this art followed immediately after
the discovery of fire, and that it was at first an imitation of the
natural processes of mastication and digestion. In proof of the antiquity
of this art, mention is made of it in many places in sacred writ.
Among these is notably the memoirs of the Children of Israel while
journeying in the wilderness, and their hankering after the "flesh-pots
of Egypt."</p>

<p>Among the most enlightened people of ancient times,&mdash;cooking, if
not regarded as one of the fine arts, certainly stood in the foremost
rank among the useful. It was a highly honored vocation, and many
of the most eminent and illustrious characters of Greece and Rome
did not disdain to practice it. Among the distinguished amateurs of
the art, in these modern times, may be mentioned Alexander Dumas,
who plumed himself more upon his ability to cook famous dishes
than upon his world-wide celebrity as the author of the most popular
novels of his day.</p>

<p>In the state in which man finds most of the substances used for
food they are difficult of digestion. By the application of heat some
of these are rendered more palatable and more easily digested, and,
consequently, that assimilation so necessary to the sustenance of life,
and the repair of the constant waste attendant upon the economy of
the human system. The application of heat to animal and vegetable
substances, for the attainment of this end, constitutes the basis of the
science of cookery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Broiling</span>, which was most probably the mode first resorted to in
the early practice of this art, being one of the most common of its
various operations, is quite simple and efficacious. It is especially
adapted to the wants of invalids, and persons of delicate appetites.
Its effect is to coagulate, in the quickest manner, upon the surface
the albumen of the meat, effectually sealing up its pores, and thus
retaining the rich juices and delicate flavor that would otherwise
escape and be lost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roasting</span> comes next in order, and for this two conditions are
essentially requisite&mdash;a good, brisk fire, and constant basting. As in
the case of broiling, care should be taken at the commencement to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
coagulate the albumen on the surface as speedily as possible. Next
to broiling and stewing, this is the most economical mode of cooking
meats of all kinds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baking</span> meat is in very many respects objectionable&mdash;and should
never be resorted to when other modes of cooking are available, as it
reverses the order of good, wholesome cookery, in beginning with a
slow and finishing with a high temperature. Meats cooked in this
manner have never the delicate flavor of the roast, nor are they so
easily digested.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boiling</span> is one of the easiest and simplest methods of cooking,
but in its practice certain conditions must be carefully observed. The
fire must be attended to, so as to properly regulate the heat. The
utensils used for this purpose, which should be large enough to contain
sufficient water to completely cover the meat, should be scrupulously
clean, and provided with a close-fitting cover. All scum should
be removed as fast as it rises, which will be facilitated by frequent
additions of small quantities of cold water. Difference of opinion
exists among cooks as to the propriety of putting meats in cold water,
and gradually raising to the boiling point, or plunging into water
already boiling. My own experience, unless in the preparation of
soups, is decidedly in favor of the latter. Baron Liebig, the highest
authority in such matters, decidedly favors this process. As in the
case of roasting, the application of boiling water coagulates the albumen,
thus retaining the juices of the meat that would be dissolved in
the liquid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stewing</span> is generally resorted to in the preparation of made
dishes, and almost every variety of meats are adapted to this method.
The better the quality of the meats, as a matter of course, the better
the dish prepared in this way; but, by careful stewing, the coarser and
rougher quality of meats can be rendered soft, tender and digestible,
a desirable object not generally attained in other modes. Add pieces
of meat, trimmings, scraps and bones, the latter containing a large
amount of palatable and nourishing gelatine, may be thus utilized
in the preparation of wholesome and appetizing dishes at a comparatively
trifling cost.</p>


<h3>An Explanatory Word in Conclusion.</h3>

<p>As a matter of strict justice to all parties concerned, the author
of this work deems it proper to explain his reasons for mentioning in
the body of some of the recipes given in this book, the places at which
the purest and best articles used are to be purchased. This recom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>mendation
is, in every instance, based upon a thorough and complete
personal test of every article commended. In these degenerate days of
wholesale adulteration of almost every article of food and drink, it is
eminently just and proper that the public should be advised where
the genuine is to be procured. Without desiring to convert his book
into a mere advertising medium, the author deems it not out of place
to give the names of those dealers in this city of whom such articles
as are essential in the preparation of many of the recipes given in
these pages may be procured&mdash;of the most reliable quality, and at
reasonable rates.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a><br /><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="SOUPS" id="SOUPS"></a>SOUPS.</h2>


<h3>Stock.</h3>

<p>The foundation&mdash;so to speak&mdash;and first great essential in compounding
every variety of appetizing, and at the same time
wholesome and nourishing soups, is the stock. In this department,
as in some others, the French cooks have ever been pre-eminent.
It was said of this class in the olden time that so
constantly was the "stock"&mdash;as this foundation has always been
termed&mdash;replenished by these cooks, that their rule was never
to see the bottom of the soup kettle. It has long been a fixed
fact that in order to have good soup you must first have good
stock to begin with. To make this stock, take the liquor left
after boiling fresh meat, bones, (large or small, cracking the
larger ones in order to extract the marrow,) bones and meat left
over from a roast or broil, and put either or all of these in a
large pot or soup kettle, with water enough to cover. Let these
simmer slowly&mdash;never allowing the water to boil&mdash;taking care,
however, to keep the vessel covered&mdash;stirring frequently, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
pouring in occasionally a cup of cold water, and skimming off
the scum. It is only where fresh meat is used that cold water
is applied at the commencement; for cooked meat, use warm.
The bones dissolved in the slow simmering, furnish the gelatine
so essential to good stock. One quart of water to a pound of
meat is the average rule. Six to eight hours renders it fit for use.
Let stand over night; skim off the fat; put in an earthen jar,
and it is ready for use. Every family should keep a jar of the
stock constantly on hand, as by doing so any kind of soup may
be made from it in from ten to thirty minutes.</p>


<h3>General Directions for Making Soup.</h3>

<p>Having prepared your stock according to the foregoing directions,
take a sufficient quantity, when soup is required, and season,
as taste may dictate, with sweet and savory herbs&mdash;salpicant,
celery salt, or any other favorite seasoning&mdash;adding
vegetables cut fine, and let the same boil slowly in a covered
vessel until thoroughly cooked. If preferred, after seasoning
the stock, it may be thickened with either barley, rice, tapioca,
sago, vermicelli, macaroni, farina or rice flour. A roast onion
is sometimes added to give richness and flavor. It is a well-known
fact that soups properly prepared improve in flavor and
are really better on the day after than when first made. By
substituting different materials, garnitures, flavorings and condiments,
of which an endless variety is available, the intelligent
housewife may be able to furnish a different soup for every day
of the year. In following these, as in all other directions for
every department of cookery, experience will, after all, be found
the great teacher and most valuable aid and adjunct to the
learner of the art.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>


<h3>Calves'-Head Soup.</h3>

<p>Take a calf's head of medium size; wash clean, and soak it
an hour or more in salted water; then soak a little while in fresh,
and put to boil in cold water; add a little salt and a medium-sized
onion; take off the scum as it rises, and as the water boils
away add a little soup stock; when quite tender take the meat
from the bone, keeping the brain by itself; strain the soup, and
if you think there is too much meat, use a portion as a side-dish
dressed with brain sauce; do not cut the meat too fine&mdash;and
season the soup with allspice, cloves and mace, adding pepper
and salt to taste; put back the meat, and taking one-half the
brain, a lump of butter, and a spoonful of flour, work to a thin
batter, stirring in claret and sherry wines to taste, and last of all
add a little extract of lemon, and one hard-boiled egg, chopped
not too fine; if desirable add a few small force-meat balls.</p>

<p>[Turtle soup may be made in the same manner.]</p>


<h3>Ox-Tail Soup.</h3>

<p>Take one ox-tail and divide into pieces an inch long; 2
pounds of lean beef cut in small pieces; 4 carrots; 3 onions
sliced fine; a little thyme, with pepper and salt to taste, and 4
quarts cold water; boil four hours or more, according to size of
the ox-tail, and when done add a little allspice or cloves.</p>


<h3>Okra Soup.</h3>

<p>One large slice of ham; 1 pound of beef, veal or chicken,
and 1 onion, all cut in small pieces and fried in butter together
until brown, adding black or red pepper for seasoning, along with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
a little salt, adding in the meantime, delicately sliced thin,
sufficient okra, and put all in a porcelain kettle. For a family
of four use 30 pods of okra, with 2 quarts water, over a steady,
but not too hot fire; boil slowly for 3 or 4 hours; when half
done add 2 or 3 peeled tomatoes.</p>


<h3>Chicken Gumbo.</h3>

<p class="center">[<span class="smcap">Mrs. E. A. Wilburn's Recipe.</span>]</p>

<p>For the stock, take two chickens and boil in a gallon of water
until thoroughly done and the liquid reduced to half a gallon.
Wipe off 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pounds of green okra, or if the dry is used, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
pound is sufficient, which cut up fine and add to this stock while
boiling; next add 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pounds of ripe tomatoes, peeled and
chopped fine, adding also <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> coffee cupful of rice; let these
boil for six hours, adding boiling water when necessary; then
take out the chickens, carve and fry them brown in clear lard;
into the fat put 1 large white onion, chopped fine, adding 2
tablespoonfuls of flour. Just before serving, put the chicken,
boned and chopped, with the gravy thus prepared, and add to
the soup with salt and pepper to taste.</p>


<h3>Fresh Oyster Soup.</h3>

<p>Take 25 or 30 small Eastern and 50 California oysters; wash
clean, and put into a kettle over the fire, with a little over a
pint of water. As soon as they open pour into a pan and take
the oysters from the shells, pouring the juice into a pitcher to
settle. If the oysters are large, cut in two once; return the
juice to the fire, and when it boils put in a piece of butter
worked in flour; season with pepper and salt, and let it boil
slowly for two minutes; put in a cupful of rich milk and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
oysters, along with a sufficient quantity of chopped crackers,
and let the liquid boil up once. Should you need a larger
quantity of soup, add a can of good oysters, as they will change
the flavor but little. In my opinion nutmeg improves the
flavor of the soup.</p>


<h3>Fish Chowder.</h3>

<p>Take 4 pounds of fresh codfish&mdash;the upper part of the fish is
best; fry plenty of salt pork cut in small strips; put the fat in the
bottom of the kettle, then a layer of the fried pork, next a layer
of fish; follow with a layer of potato sliced&mdash;not too thin&mdash;and
a layer of sliced onions, seasoned with plenty of salt and pepper;
alternate these layers as long as the material holds out, topping
off with a layer of hard crackers. Use equal parts of water and
milk sufficient to cook, which will not require more than three-quarters
of an hour, over a good fire. Great care should be
taken not to scorch in the cooking.</p>

<p>[Clam Chowder may be made according to the foregoing
formula, substituting 3 pints of clams for the fish.]</p>


<h3>Clam Soup.</h3>

<p>Take 50 small round clams; rinse clean, and put in a kettle
with a pint of water; boil for a few minutes, or until the shells
gape open; empty into a pan, pick the meat from the shells,
and pour the juice into a pitcher to settle; chop the clams quite
small; return the juice to the fire, and as soon as hot, work in a
good-sized lump of butter, with a little flour, and juice of the
clams; stir in a teacup of milk; season with black pepper, and
after letting this boil for two minutes, put in the clams, adding
at the same time chopped cracker or nudels, and before taking
up, a little chopped parsley.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>


<h3>Clam Chowder.</h3>

<p>One hundred small clams chopped fine; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pound fat salt
pork put in pot and fried out brown; 2 small or 1 large onion,
and 1 tomato chopped fine. Put all in the pot with the clam
juice and boil for two hours, after which add rolled crackers and
1 pint hot milk, letting it boil up. Season with salt and pepper,
adding a little thyme if agreeable to taste.</p>


<h3>Baked Beans and Bean Soup.</h3>

<p>Take three pints of white peas or army beans; wash very
clean; soak eight hours; rinse and put to boil with plenty of
water, hot or cold, with 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pounds beef soup-meat and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pound
of salt pork, letting these boil slowly, and skimming as the
scum rises. Stir frequently, as the beans are apt to scorch when
they begin to soften. When soft enough to be easily crushed
with the thumb and finger, season with plenty of black pepper
and salt; after five minutes have elapsed fill a nice baking
pan&mdash;such a one as will do to set on the table&mdash;pour in the
liquid until it nearly covers the beans, score the pork and put it
half-way down in the beans, and bake in a slow fire until
nicely browned.</p>

<p>When the remaining beans are boiled quite soft rub them
through a colander into the soup; add 1 pint of milk, and season
with ground cloves or mace. Just before taking up cut
some toast the size of the end of a finger and add to the soup.
Pepper sauce gives a nice flavor.</p>


<h3>Dry Split-Pea Soup.</h3>

<p>Soak one quart dry or split peas ten or twelve hours, and put
on to boil in 1 gallon of water, with 1 pound soup-beef, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
small piece of the hock end of ham, nicely skinned and trimmed,
(but if you do not have this at hand supply its place with
a small piece of salt pork;) season with salt, pepper and a little
ground cloves, adding a little curry or sweet marjoram; boil
slowly until quite tender; rub the peas through a colander, adding
a little rich milk. This soup should be rather thick. Cut
bread in pieces the size of the little finger, fry in butter or lard,
and put in the tureen when taken up.</p>


<h3>Tomato Soup.</h3>

<p>To one gallon good beef stock add 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> dozen ripe tomatoes,
or 1 two-pound can; 2 carrots, 2 onions and 1 turnip cut fine;
boil all together for an hour and a half, and run through a
fine tin strainer; take a stewpan large enough to hold the
liquid, and put it on the fire with <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pound of butter worked in
two tablespoonfuls of flour; after mixing well together add a
tablespoonful of white sugar; season with salt and pepper to
taste, stirring well until the liquor boils, when skim and serve.
The above quantity will provide sufficient for a large family.</p>


<h3>Celery Soup.</h3>

<p>To make good celery soup take 2 or 3 pounds of juicy beef&mdash;the
round is best, being free from fat. Cover with cold
water, and boil slowly for three or four hours. An hour before
taking from the fire take 1 pound or more of celery, cut 4 or 5
inches long, taking also the root cut thin, and salting to taste,
boil until quite tender; then take out the celery, dressing with
pepper and salt or drawn butter. If you have some soup stock
put in a little, boil a few minutes and strain. This is a most
palatable soup, and the celery, acting as a sedative, is one of
the best things that can be used for quieting the nerves.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>


<h3>Pepper-Pot.</h3>

<p>Take thick, fat and tender tripe; wash thoroughly in water in
which a little soda has been dissolved; rinse well, and cut in
strips half the length of your little finger; after boiling ten minutes,
put in a colander and rinse with a little hot water; then,
adding good soup stock, boil until tender; season with cayenne
pepper and salt, a little Worcestershire or Chutney sauce, and
some small pieces of dough made as for nudels. Should the
soup not be thick enough add a little paste of butter and flour;
you may also add curry if you are fond of it.</p>

<p>This soup was popular in the Quaker City fifty years ago, and
has never decreased in favor among the intelligent inhabitants.</p>


<h3>Egg-Balls for Soup</h3>

<p>Boil 3 eggs seven minutes, and mash the yolks with one raw
egg, a tablespoonful of flour and a little milk; season with pepper,
salt, and parsley or summer savory; make into balls and
boil two or three minutes, and put in the soup just before serving.
Excellent for both pea and bean soup.</p>


<h3>Nudels.</h3>

<p>Rich nudels undoubtedly form the best thickening for nice,
delicate soups, such as chicken, veal, oyster and clam. Nudels
are made with flour, milk and eggs, and a little salt, mixed to
stiff dough, rolled as thin as possible, and cut in fine shreds the
length of the little finger. In all soups where nudels are used, a
little chopped parsley should be added just before taking up.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="FISH" id="FISH"></a>FISH.</h2>


<h3>Fish.</h3>

<p>The so-termed food fishes are to be found without number in
all portions of the world, civilized and savage, and a large portion
of the inhabitants of the globe are dependant upon this
source for their subsistence. Certain learned physiologists have
put forth the theory that food-fish is brain-producing, and adds
to the mental vigor of those who subsist upon it. While we are
not disposed to controvert this consoling idea&mdash;if the theory be
true&mdash;the South Sea savages, who live upon this aliment, both
in the raw and cooked state&mdash;and the Esquimaux, whose principal
summer and winter diet is frozen fish&mdash;should be the most
intelligent people on earth.</p>

<p>The modes of preparing fish for the table are equally as numerous
as the species. The direction given by Mrs. Glass, in
a cook-book of the olden time, is at the same time the most
original and most sensible. This lady commences with:
"First catch your fish."</p>


<h3>Boiled Fish.</h3>

<p>Fresh fish should never lie in water. As soon as cleaned,
rinse off, wipe dry, wrap carefully in a cotton cloth, and put
into salted boiling water. If cooked in this manner the juice
and flavor will be fully retained. Twenty minutes boiling will
thoroughly cook a medium sized fish.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>


<h3>Fried Fish.</h3>

<p>In frying large-sized fish, cut the slices lengthwise instead of
across, for if cut against the grain the rich juices will be lost in
the cooking, rendering the fish hard, dry and tasteless. For
this reason fish are always better cooked whole, when this can
be done. Beat up one or two eggs, with two tablespoonfuls of
milk, with salt to season. After dipping the fish in this, dry in
cracker dust&mdash;never use corn meal&mdash;and fry in good lard.</p>


<h3>Broiling Fish.</h3>

<p>In broiling fish, cut large as in frying, grease the bars of the
gridiron. Harden both sides slightly, and baste with butter,
seasoning with pepper and salt.</p>


<h3>Fried Oysters.</h3>

<p>Take large oysters, drain the juice, and dry them with
a cloth, and run them in eggs, well beaten with a little milk;
season with pepper and a little salt, and after drying in cracker
dust, fry in equal parts best lard and butter, until a light brown.</p>


<h3>Oysters in Batter.</h3>

<p>Save all the juice of the oysters; beat two eggs with two or
three spoonfuls of milk or cream, seasoning with pepper; put
this into the juice, with the addition of as much flour as will
make a rich batter. When the fat is quite hot put into it a
spoonful of the batter, containing one oyster, and turn quickly
in order that both sides may be nicely done brown.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>


<h3>Oyster Patties.</h3>

<p>Roll good puff-paste quite thin&mdash;and cut in round pieces 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inches in diameter, on which put a rim of dough, about 1 inch
or less high, which may be stuck on with a little beaten egg;
next add a top-piece or covering, fitting loosely, and bake in
this until a light brown, and put away until wanted. Stew oysters
in their own juice, adding a little butter and cream; fill the
patties with this, put on the lid, and set in the oven for five
minutes, and send to the table. Can oysters, with a rich gravy,
make an excellent patty prepared in this way.</p>


<h3>Stewed Lobsters or Crabs.</h3>

<p>Take a two-pound can of lobster, or two large crabs, and cut
as for making salad, and season highly with prepared mustard,
cayenne pepper, curry powder, or sauce piquant, and salt to
taste. Put in a porcelain stewpan, with a little water, to prevent
scorching, and, after letting it boil up once, add butter the
size of an egg, and one tablespoonful of vinegar, or half a teacupful
of white wine, and the juice of half a lemon, and the
moment this boils add half a teacupful of cream or good milk,
stirring at the same time. Set the stew aside, and heat up
shortly before sending to the table. Putting slices of toast in
the bottom of the dish before serving is a decided improvement.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="Roast_Boiled_Baked_Broiled" id="Roast_Boiled_Baked_Broiled"></a>Roast, Boiled, Baked, Broiled
and Fried.</h2>


<h3>Retaining the Juices in Cooking Meats.</h3>

<p>Too little attention is paid to one of the most important features
of the culinary art&mdash;particularly in roasting, boiling, and broiling&mdash;that
is the retention of the natural juices of various meats
in cooking. Existing, as these always do, in a liquid form,
unless this is carefully guarded against, these palatable and
health-giving essences of all animal food, both tame and game,
are apt to be wasted and dissipated in various forms, when the
exercise of mature judgment and a little care would confine
them to these meats in the course of preparation. By way of
illustration, let us suppose that a fowl, a leg of mutton, or some
of the many kinds of fish frequently served up in this way, is
to be boiled in water. If put in cold water, and the heat gradually
raised until it reaches the boiling point, the health-giving
albumen&mdash;with the juices which give each its peculiar and
pleasant flavor&mdash;are extracted from the meat and dissolved and
retained in the water, rendering the flesh and fish insipid and
in some cases almost tasteless. If, however, these are plunged
at once into boiling water, thereby on the instant coagulating
the albumen of the surface at least, and thereby closing the
pores through which the inside albuminous juices would otherwise
exude and be lost. Besides this albumen, there are other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
juices which are among the most important constituent parts of
every variety of animal food in which are embodied much of
its fine flavor and nutritive qualities, and deprived of which such
food becomes unpalatable and tasteless. All meats, then, instead
of being put into cold water, should at the start be
plunged into boiling hot water, as this prevents the escape of
these juices, and the retaining not only the delicate and fine
flavor of the meat, but confining and retaining its nutritive
qualities where they naturally and properly belong.</p>


<h3>Roast Pig.</h3>

<p>Take a sucking pig&mdash;one from three to five weeks old is
best. When properly dressed lay in salted water for half an
hour; take out and wipe dry inside and out; make a stuffing of
bread and butter, mixing to a proper consistency with milk and a
well beaten egg; season with salt, pepper and sage, with the
addition of thyme or summer savory, and an onion chopped
fine and stewed in butter with flour. Sew up, and roast for a
long time in an oven not too hot, first putting a little water
with lard or dripping in the pan. Baste frequently until done,
taking care to keep the pan a little distance above the bottom
of the range.</p>


<h3>To Roast Turkeys and Chickens.</h3>

<p>Turkeys and chickens for roasting should never be over a
year old. After being properly cleaned, cut the wings at the
first joint from the breast, pull the skin down the lower end of
the neck, and cut off the bone. Cut the necks, wings and giz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>zards
into small pieces suitable for giblet stew&mdash;which should
be put on the fire before preparing the fowls for roasting&mdash;which
should be done by cutting off the legs at the first joint
from the feet. Make the stuffing of good bread, rubbed fine,
with butter, pepper and salt, and a teaspoonful of baking powder,
seasoning with thyme or summer savory, mixing to the
consistency of dough, adding eggs, well beaten, with good milk
or cream. Fill the breast, and tie over the neck-bone with
strong twine, rubbing the sides of the fowl with a dry cloth,
afterwards filling quite full. Sew up tight, tie up the legs, and
encase the body with strong twine, wrapped around to hold the
wings to the body. After rubbing well with salt and dredging
lightly with flour, put the fowl in a pan, laying on top two or
three thin slices of fat pork, salt or fresh. Put a little water in
the pan, and baste frequently, but do not roast too rapidly;
raise the pan at least two inches from the bottom of the range.
All white meat should invariably be cooked well done, and
turkey or chicken, to be eaten cold, should be wrapped while
warm in paper or cloth. When prepared in this way they will
always be found soft and tender when cooled.</p>

<p>When the giblets are stewed tender&mdash;which they must be in
order to be good&mdash;chop a handful of the green leaves of celery,
adding pepper and salt, and put in. Ten minutes before taking
from the fire add a lump of butter worked in with a tablespoonful
of flour and the yolk of two boiled eggs, letting simmer two
or three minutes, then put in the whites of the eggs, chopped
fine, with the addition of a little good milk or cream. Some
of this stew, mixed with the drippings of the fowl, makes the
best possible gravy.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>


<h3>Roasting Beef.</h3>

<p>Never wash meat; simply wipe with a damp cloth, rub with
salt and dredge with flour; put in the pan with a little of the
suet chopped fine, and a teacupful of water; set in a hot oven,
two inches above the bottom. The oven should be quite hot,
in order to close the pores on the surface of the meat as quickly
as possible. As the meat hardens reduce the heat a little,
basting frequently. Turn two or three times during the roasting,
taking care not to let the gravy scorch. Meat cooked in
this way will be tender and juicy, and when done will be slightly
red in the centre. Should it prove too rare, carve thin and lay
in a hot pan with a little gravy for one minute. Beef will roast
in from one and-half to two hours, according to size. All meats
may be roasted in the same way, taking care in every case, that
the albuminous juices do not escape.</p>


<h3>A Good Way to Roast a Leg of Mutton.</h3>

<p>Into a kettle, with hot water enough to cover, put a leg of
mutton. Let it boil half an hour, and the moment it is taken
from the water, salt, pepper, and dredge with flour, and put
on to roast with one-half a teacup of water in the pan. Baste
frequently, first adding a tablespoonful of lard. Cooked in this
way the meat has none of the peculiar mutton flavor which is
distasteful to many.</p>


<h3>Clayton's Mode of Cooking Canvas-back Ducks.</h3>

<p>That most delicately flavored wild fowl, the canvas-back
duck, to be properly cooked, should be prepared in the following
style:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>The bird being properly dressed and cleaned, place in the
opening, after drawing, a tablespoonful of salt dissolved in water&mdash;some
add a stick of celery, or celery salt, to flavor, but this
is not necessary. Sew up the opening with strong thread; have
your fire in the grate red hot&mdash;that is, the oven almost red hot;
place your duck therein, letting it remain nineteen minutes&mdash;which
will be amply sufficient time if your oven is at the proper
heat&mdash;but as tastes differ in this as in other matters of cookery,
some prefer a minute longer and others one less. Serve the
duck as hot as possible, with an accompanying dish of hominy,
boiled, of course; the only condiment to be desired is a little
cayenne pepper; some prefer a squeeze of lemon on the duck;
others currant jelly; but the simplest and most palatable serving
is the directions given.</p>


<h3>Clayton's Mode of Cooking California Quail, or
Young Chickens.</h3>

<p>Split the birds in the back, and wash, but do not let them remain
in the water any time; dry with a cloth; salt and pepper
well, and put in a pan with the inside up; also put in two or
three slices of fresh or salt pork, and a piece of butter about the
size of an egg, with three or four tablespoonfuls of water, and
set the pan on the upper shelf of the range when quite hot, and
commence basting frequently the moment the birds begin to
harden on the top; and when slightly brown turn and serve the
under side the same way, until that is also a little brown, taking
care not to scorch the gravy. Having prepared a piece of buttered
toast for each bird, lay the same in a hot dish, place the
birds thereon, and pour the gravy over all. Birds cooked in
this manner are always soft and juicy&mdash;whereas, if broiled, all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
juices and gravy would have gone into the fire&mdash;and should
you attempt cooking in that way, if not thoroughly, constantly
basted, they are liable to burn; and if basted with butter it runs
into the fire, smoking and destroying their rich natural flavor.</p>

<p>I have been thus particular in the directions detailed in this
recipe, from the fact that many people have an idea that the
quail of California are not equal to that of the Atlantic States,
when, from my experience with both, which has been considerable,
I find no difference in the flavor and juiciness of the birds
when cooked in the way I have carefully laid down in the foregoing
simple and easily understood directions.</p>


<h3>To Cook Boned Turkey.</h3>

<p>For the filling of the turkey, boil, skin, trim, and cut the
size of the end of your finger, two fresh calves' tongues. At
the same time boil for half-an-hour in soup stock, or very little
water, a medium-sized, but not old, chicken; take all the meat
from the bones, and cut as the calves' tongues. Take a piece of
ham, composed of fat and lean, and cut small; also the livers
of the turkey and the chicken, chopped fine, along with a small
piece of veal, mostly fat, cut as the chicken, and half an onion
chopped fine.</p>

<p>Put all these into a kettle with water to half cover, and stew
until tender. At the time of putting on the fire, season with
salt and pepper, ground mace, salpicant, celery salt and a little
summer savory. Just before taking from the fire stir in the
yolks of two eggs, well beaten, with three or four truffles chopped
the size of a pea, and a teacupful of sherry or white wine.
When this mixture is cold put it in the turkey, with the skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
side out; draw it carefully around the filling, and sew up with a
strong thread; and after wrapping it very tightly with strong
twine, encase it in two or three thicknesses of cotton cloth, at
the same time twisting the ends slightly. These precautions
are necessary to prevent the escape of the fine flavor of this
delicious preparation. Boil slowly for four hours or longer, in
good soup stock, keeping the turkey covered with the liquid,
and the vessel covered also. When taken up lay on a level
surface, with a weight, to flatten the two sides a little, but not
heavy enough to press out the juice. When quite cold take off
the wrapping and thread, and lay on a nice large dish, garnishing
with amber jelly cut the size of peas.</p>


<h3>To Bone a Turkey.</h3>

<p>Use a French boning knife, five inches in length and sharp
at the point. Commence by cutting off the wings at the first
joint from the breast; then the first joint from the drum-sticks,
and the head, well down the neck. Next place the bird firmly
on the table, with the breast down, and commence by cutting
from the end of the neck, down the centre of the back, through
to the bone, until you reach the Pope's nose. Then skin or
peel the flesh as clean as possible from the frame, finishing at
the lower end of the breast-bone.</p>

<p>Chickens may be boned in the same manner</p>


<h3>To Cook Ducks or Chickens, Louisiana Style.</h3>

<p>Carve the fowls at the joints, making three or four pieces of
the breast; wash nicely in salted water, and put on to boil with
water enough to cover, adding a little salt; boil slowly; care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>fully
skimming off the scum. When the meat begins to get
tender and the water well reduced, cook four onions, chopped
fine, in a pan with pork fat and butter, dredging in a little flour
and seasoning with pepper and salt, adding a little of the juice
from the fowls. Next take up the pieces of the meat and roll
in browned flour or cracker-dust, and fry slightly. If the butter
is not scorched put in a little browned flour; stir in the onion,
and put it back in the kettle with the meat of the fowl, simmering
until the gravy thickens, and the meat is thoroughly tender.</p>


<h3>Breast of Lamb and Chicken, Breaded.</h3>

<p>Take the breast of lamb and one chicken&mdash;a year old is best&mdash;and
after taking off the thin skin of the lamb, wash it well in
cold salted water; then put on to boil, with sufficient cold
slightly-salted water to cover it, and boil until tender&mdash;the addition
of a medium-sized onion improves the flavor&mdash;then take
up, and when quite cold, carve in nice pieces, and season with
black pepper and salt. Next, beat two eggs, with two or three
spoonfuls of milk or cream, and a spoonful of flour. After
running the meat through this, roll in cracker-dust or browned
flour, and fry in sweet lard and a little butter until a light brown.
Next make a cream gravy; take a little of the liquid from the
chicken, and make a rich thick drawn butter, and thinning it
with cream, pour over the chicken while it is hot.</p>

<p>[The liquid used in boiling the chicken will make any kind
of rich soup for dinner.]</p>


<h3>Scrapple, or Haggis Loaf.</h3>

<p>Take three or four pounds best fresh pork, mostly lean, with
plenty of bones&mdash;the latter making a rich liquid. Put these
into a kettle, and cover with hot or cold water, and let the mass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
boil slowly for two or three hours, or until quite tender, carefully
removing the scum as it rises, after which take the meat
out into a wooden bowl or tray. Pick out the bones carefully,
and strain the liquid. After letting these stand for a few minutes,
if in your opinion there is too much fat, remove a portion,
and then return the liquor to the kettle, adding pepper and salt,
and seasoning highly with summer savory. Next stir in two
parts fine white corn-meal and one part buckwheat flour (Deming
&amp; Palmer's), until the whole forms quite a thick mush,
after which, chopping the meat the size of the end of the finger,
stir thoroughly into the mush. Next put the mixture into
baking pans to the depth of 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> or 2 inches, and bake in a slow
oven for two hours, or until the top assumes a light brown&mdash;taking
care not to bake too hard on the bottom. Put in a cool
place, and the next morning&mdash;when, after warming the pan
slightly&mdash;so that the scrapple may be easily taken out&mdash;cut
in slices of half-an-inch thick, which heat in a pan to prevent
sticking, and serve hot.</p>

<p>[A small hog's head or veal is equally good for the preparation
of this dish, which will be found a fine relish.]</p>


<h3>Pigs' Feet and Hocks.</h3>

<p>Have the feet nicely cleaned, and soaked for five or six
hours, or over night, in slightly salted water. Boil until tender,
and the large bones slip out easily, which will take from three
to four hours. Take up, pull out the large bones, and lay in a
stone jar, sprinkling on each layer a little salt and pepper, with
a few cloves or allspice. After skimming off the fat, take equal
parts of the water in which the feet were boiled, and good
vinegar, and cover the meat in the jar.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>This nice relish was known as "souse" fifty or sixty years
ago, and is good, both cold or hot, or cut in slices and fried in
butter for breakfast.</p>


<h3>To Cook a Steak California Style of 1849-'50.</h3>

<p>Cut a good steak an inch and an eighth thick. Heat a griddle
quite hot, and rub over with a piece of the fat from the steak,
after which lay on the steak for two or three minutes, or long
enough to harden the under side of the steak, after which turn
the other side, treating in the same way, thus preventing all
escape of the rich juices of the meat. After this, cut a small
portion of the fat into small and thin pieces, to which add sufficient
butter to form a rich gravy, seasoning with pepper and salt
to taste. A steak cooked in this way fully equals broiling, and
is at the same time quite as juicy and tender.</p>


<h3>A Good Way to Cook a Ham.</h3>

<p>Boil a ten or twelve pound ham slowly for three hours; strip
off the skin; take a sharp knife and shave off the outer surface
very thin, and if quite fat take off a little, and spread over
the fat part a thin coating of sugar. Next put the ham in
a baking-pan, with one-half pint of white wine, and roast
half-an-hour. Baste often, taking care that the wine and juice
of the ham do not scorch, as these form a nice gravy. Whether
eaten hot or cold the ham should be carved very thin.</p>


<h3>Beefsteak Broiled.</h3>

<p>Place the gridiron over a clear fire; rub the bars with a little
of the fat, to keep from sticking. The moment it hardens a
little&mdash;which closes the pores of the meat&mdash;turn it over, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
hardening both sides. You may then moisten with butter, or a
little of the fat of the steak, and season with salt and pepper.
Lay on a hot dish along with the best butter, which, with the
juices of the meat, makes the best of gravy, and cooked in this
style you have a most delicious steak.</p>


<h3>Beefsteak with Onions.</h3>

<p>Take five or six onions; cut fine, and put them in a frying-pan,
with a small cup of hot water, and two ounces best butter,
pepper and salt; dredge in a little flour, and let it stew until the
onions are quite soft. Next broil the steak carefully. Lay on
a hot dish, and lay the onions around, and not on top, of the
steak, as that will create a steam, which will wilt and toughen
it. To be eaten quite hot.</p>


<h3>Corned Beef, and How to Cook It.</h3>

<p>Select a piece of corned beef that is fat. The plate or navel
pieces are best, and should only have been in salt five days.
Put the piece in boiling water in a pot just large enough to hold
it, along with an onion and a spoonful of cloves or allspice; let it
boil slowly, skimming the first half hour, if to be eaten cold.
Take it up as soon as tender, and when cool enough take out
the bones and place the meat in a vessel just large enough to
hold it, and pour in the fat, with sufficient hot water to cover it,
letting it remain until quite cold.</p>

<p>[Beef tongues should be cooked in the same way, after laying
in salt or strong pickle from twenty-four to thirty-six hours.]</p>


<h3>Spiced Veal.</h3>

<p>Take three pounds lean veal, parboiled, and one-fourth
pound salt pork, each chopped fine; six soft crackers pounded;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
two eggs beaten; two teaspoonfuls of salt, three peppers, one
nutmeg and a little thyme or summer savory. Mould up like
bread, and place in a pan, leaving a space all around, in which
place some of the water in which the meat was boiled.
Bake until quite brown, and slice when cold.</p>


<h3>Calves' Liver with Bacon.</h3>

<p>Cut both liver and bacon in thin slices, and an inch long,
taking off the skin. Place alternately on a skewer, and broil or
roast in a quick oven. Dress with melted butter, pepper and
juice of lemon.</p>


<h3>Calves' or Lambs' Liver Fried.</h3>

<p>Slice the liver thin, and season with salt and pepper. Beat
an egg with a spoonful of milk or cream. Coat the slices with
this, and dry in fine cracker dust. Fry in two parts lard and one
of butter until a light brown. If fried too much the liver will
be hard and tasteless. Salt pork fried brown is very nice with
liver, and the fat from the pork will be found excellent to fry
the liver in.</p>


<h3>Spiced Beef.</h3>

<p>Take 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pounds lean beef chopped small; six soda crackers
rolled fine; 3 eggs well beaten; 4 tablespoonfuls sweet cream;
butter size of an egg; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tablespoonfuls salt, and one of pepper.
Mix thoroughly, make into a loaf, and bake two hours, basting
as you would roast beef.</p>


<h3>Fried Oysters.</h3>

<p>Take the largest-sized oysters; drain off the juice, and dry in
a cloth; beat two eggs in a spoonful of milk, adding a little salt
and pepper. Run the oysters through this, and fry in equal
parts butter and sweet lard to a light brown.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<h3>Terrapin Stew.</h3>

<p>Take six terrapins of uniform size. (The females, which are
the best, may be distinguished by the lower shell being level or
slightly projecting.) If the terrapins are large, use one pound
of the best butter; if small, less, and a pint of good sherry
wine. After washing the terrapins in warm water, put them in
the kettle alive, and cover with cold water, keeping the vessel
covered tight. After letting them boil until the shell cracks and
you can crush the claws with the thumb and finger, take them
off the fire, and when cool enough, pull off the shell and remove
the dark, or scarf skin, next pulling the meat from the
trail and the liver&mdash;being careful not to break the gall, which
would render the liver uneatable. After breaking the meat in
small pieces, lay it in a porcelain kettle with a teacupful of
water; put in the wine, and one-half the butter, with 2 or 3
blades of mace, 2 or 3 teaspoonfuls of extract of lemon, 2
tablespoonfuls of Worcestershire or Challenge sauce; little salt
is required, and if pepper is needed, use cayenne. After stewing
for fifteen minutes, add the yolks of 6 hard-boiled eggs&mdash;worked
to a paste in the remainder of the butter&mdash;thinning with
the juice of the stew, adding at the same time a teacupful of
sweet cream, and after simmering for three minutes, chop the
whites of the eggs fine, and add to the mixture; then take from
the fire, and make hot five minutes before serving. If kept in
a cool place this stew will remain perfectly good for three days.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>


<h3>Stewed Chicken, Cottage Style, with White Gravy.</h3>

<p>Take two chickens, one or two years old, and cut each in
about fourteen pieces, dividing each joint, and cutting the breast
in two pieces; cut the gizzard quite small, and put it and the
liver with the chicken. When the chicken is half done, cover
with cold water, adding a good-sized onion, and when it reaches
a boil, skim carefully; and when the same is about half cooked
add sufficient salt and pepper, and also a handful of the green
leaves of celery chopped fine, which will give it the flavor of
oysters. Boil slowly until you can tear the chicken with a fork,
when turn it out in a dish. Next, take one half pound of good
butter, the yolks of three boiled eggs, and two tablespoonfuls of
corn-starch or flour, and, after working well together, so as to
form a thin batter, add the liquor from the chicken, return to
the kettle, and, after boiling for five minutes, return the chicken,
season with nutmeg or sal-piquant, adding at the same time a
teacupful of cream or good milk, also the whites of the eggs,
chopped fine. Keep hot until served.</p>


<h3>Stewed Tripe.</h3>

<p>Cut and prepare the tripe as for pepper-pot; season highly;
add a pint of soup stock, and four spoonfuls of tomatoes, with a
little butter, and half an onion chopped fine. Cook until quite
tender.</p>


<h3>Chicken Salad.</h3>

<p>Boil a good-sized chicken, not less than one year old, in as
little water as possible; if you have two calves' feet boil them at
the same time, salting slightly, and leaving them in after the
chicken is cooked, that they may boil to shreds. This liquid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
forms a jelly, which is almost indispensable in making good
salad. When the chicken becomes cold, remove the skin and
bones, after which chop or cut to the size of a pea; cut celery
and lettuce equally fine&mdash;after taking off the outer fibre of the
former&mdash;and mixing, add Clayton's Salad Dressing, (the recipe
for which will be found elsewhere); also incorporating four
eggs, which should be boiled eight minutes, cutting three as fine
as the chicken and celery, and leaving the fourth as a garnish
on serving. Cold roast turkey, chicken or tender veal make
most excellent salad treated in this way.</p>


<h3>Clayton's Celebrated California Salad Dressing.</h3>

<p>Take a large bowl, resembling in size and shape an ordinary
wash-bowl, and a wooden spoon, fitted as nearly as possible to
fit the curve of the bowl. First put in two or three tablespoonfuls
of mixed mustard, quite stiff. Pour on this, slowly, one-fourth
of a pint of best olive oil, stirring rapidly until thick;
then break in two or three fresh eggs, and, after mixing slightly,
pour in, very slowly, the remaining three-fourths of the pint of
oil, stirring rapidly all the while until the mixture forms a thick
batter. Next, take a teacupful of the best wine vinegar, to which
the juice of one lemon has been added, along with a small
tablespoonful of salt, and another of white sugar, stirring well,
until the whole of these ingredients are thoroughly incorporated.
When bottled and tightly corked, this mixture will remain
good for months. Those who are not fond of the oil,
will find that sweet cream, of about sixty or seventy degrees in
temperature, a good substitute; but this mixture does not keep
so well.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>


<h3>Salad Flavoring.</h3>

<p>It will be found a good thing before ornamenting a salad, to
take a section of garlic, and, after cutting off the end, steeping
it in salt, and then rubbing the surface of the bowl, putting in
at the same time, small pieces of the crust of French or other
bread, similarly treated. Cover the bowl with a plate, and
shake well. This gives the salad a rich, nutty flavor.</p>




<h2><a name="Eggs_and_Omelettes" id="Eggs_and_Omelettes"></a>Eggs and Omelettes.</h2>


<h3>Boiling Eggs.</h3>

<p>Unless quite sure the eggs are fresh, never boil them, as the
well known remark that even to suspect an egg cooked in this
style is undoubtedly well-founded. Hard boiled eggs, to be
eaten either hot or cold, must never be boiled more than eight
minutes, when they will be found tender and of a fine flavor,
whereas, if boiled for a longer time, they will invariably prove
leathery, tough, and almost tasteless, and dark-colored where
the whites and yolk are joined, giving them an unsightly and
anything but attractive appearance.</p>

<p>For soft boiled, three, and for medium, four minutes only,
are necessary.</p>


<h3>Scrambled Eggs.</h3>

<p>Beat well three eggs, with two tablespoonfuls of cream or
milk; add salt and pepper; put in the pan a lump of fresh but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>ter,
and, as soon as melted, put in the eggs, stirring rapidly
from the time they begin to set; as in order to be tender they
must be cooked quickly.</p>


<h3>To Fry Eggs.</h3>

<p>Put butter or lard in a hot pan, and then as many small, deep
muffin rings as eggs required. Drop the eggs in the rings.
Cooked in this manner the eggs are less liable to burn, look far
nicer, and preserve their fine flavor.</p>


<h3>Oyster Omelette.</h3>

<p>Stew a few oysters in a little butter, adding pepper for seasoning,
and when the omelette is cooked on the under side, put
on the oysters, roll over, and turn carefully. A good omelette
may be made of canned oysters treated in this way.</p>


<h3>Ham Omelette.</h3>

<p>Take a thin slice of the best ham&mdash;fat and lean&mdash;fry well
done, and chop fine. When the omelette is prepared, stir in
the ham, and cook to a light brown.</p>


<h3>Cream Omelette.</h3>

<p>Beat three eggs with two tablespoonfuls of cream, adding a
little salt and pepper. Put a lump of butter in the pan, but do
not let it get too hot before putting in the mixture. The pan
should be about the temperature for baking batter cakes. Fold
and turn over quite soon. The omelette should be a light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
brown, and be sent to the table hot. Should you have sausage
for breakfast, the bright gravy from the sausage is preferable to
butter in preparing the omelette.</p>


<h3>Spanish Omelette.</h3>

<p>Make in the same manner as the cream omelette, but before
putting in the pan have ready one-half an onion, chopped fine
and fried brown, with a little pepper and salt. When the
omelette is cooked on one side, put the mixture on, and turn
the sides over until closed tight.</p>


<h3>Omelette for Dessert.</h3>

<p>Beat eight eggs thoroughly, with a teacup of rich milk or
cream, a tablespoonful of fine white sugar, and a very little salt.
Stir well, and make in two omelettes; lay side by side, and sift
over a thin coating of fine white sugar. In serving, pour over
and around the omelette a wine-glass of good California brandy,
and set on fire.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="VEGETABLES" id="VEGETABLES"></a>VEGETABLES.</h2>


<h3>Baked Tomatoes.</h3>

<p>Pick out large, fair tomatoes; cut a slice from the stem end,
and, placing them in a pan with the cut side up, put into each
one-half teaspoonful of melted butter, sprinkle with salt and
pepper, and bake until they shrivel slightly.</p>


<h3>Raw Tomatoes.</h3>

<p>Cut the skin from both ends; slice moderately thin, and, if
you like, add a small piece of onion chopped fine. Season
with salt and pepper, and pour over Durkee's or Clayton's salad
dressing.</p>


<h3>Cucumbers.</h3>

<p>Take off a thick rind, as that portion between the seed and
outer skin is the unwholesome part. Slice, rather thin, into
cold, salt water, and, after half-an-hour, drain off, and dress with
salt, pepper, wine vinegar, and a little Chile pepper-sauce,
covering slightly with Durkee's or Clayton's salad dressing.</p>


<h3>Boiled Cabbage.</h3>

<p>Cut large cabbage in four; small in two pieces, and tie up in
a bag or cloth. Put in boiling water, with some salt, and boil
briskly for half-an-hour. A piece of charcoal in the pot will
neutralize the odor given out by the cabbage, boiled in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
ordinary way. Cabbage should never be cooked with corned-beef,
as the fine flavor of the latter is changed to the strong odor
of the cabbage.</p>


<h3>To Cook Cauliflower.</h3>

<p>If the cauliflower is large, divide in three, if small, in two
pieces; tie up in a cloth, and put in boiling water with a little
salt, and cook not more than twenty minutes. Eat with melted
butter, pepper and salt, or nice drawn butter.</p>

<p>(Asparagus may be cooked in the same way, and eaten with
similar dressing. Both cauliflower and asparagus may be
spoiled with too much cooking. Care should be taken to drain
the water from both as soon as they are done.)</p>


<h3>To Cook Young Green Peas.</h3>

<p>The best mode of cooking this most delicate and finely-flavored
vegetable&mdash;put the peas in a porcelain-lined kettle, with
just water sufficient to cover, and let them boil slowly until tender.
Add a lump of butter, worked in a teaspoonful of flour,
to the rich liquid, with half a teacupful of rich milk or cream;
season with salt and pepper.</p>


<h3>A Good Way to Cook Beets.</h3>

<p>Take beets of a uniform size; boil until tender; slip off the
skin, and slice into a dish or pan; season with salt and pepper,
adding a little butter, made hot, and the juice of one lemon.
Pour this over the beets, set in a hot oven for a few minutes,
and send to the table hot.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>


<h3>Mashed Potatoes and Turnips.</h3>

<p>Take equal quantities of boiled potatoes and turnips; mash
together, adding butter, salt and pepper, and mix thoroughly
with a little good milk, working all together until quite smooth.</p>


<h3>Boiled Onions.</h3>

<p>Take small white onions, if you have them; if large, cut and
boil until tender, in salted water. Pour off nearly all the water,
and add a small lump of butter, worked in a little flour, and a
small cup of milk; add pepper, and simmer for a few minutes.</p>

<p>[All the foregoing are desirable additions to roast turkey and
chicken.]</p>


<h3>Stewed Corn.</h3>

<p>If canned corn is used, put a sufficient quantity in a stewpan,
with two or three spoonfuls of hot water, and, after adding pepper
and salt to taste, put in a good-sized lump of butter, into
which a teaspoonful of flour has been well worked, adding, at
the same time, a cup of good, sweet milk or rich cream, and
let it cook three minutes. Corn cut fresh from the cob should
be boiled at least twenty minutes before adding the milk and
butter.</p>


<h3>Stewed Corn and Tomatoes.</h3>

<p>Take equal quantities of corn and tomatoes, and stew together
half-an-hour, with butter, pepper and salt; and when taken up
place slices of buttered toast in the dish in which it is served.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>


<h3>Succotash.</h3>

<p>This is the original native American Indian name for corn
and beans. In compounding this most palatable and wholesome
dish, take two or three pounds of green, climbing, or pole
beans&mdash;the pods of which are large, and, at the same time, tender.
Break these in pieces of something like half-an-inch long,
and let them lie in cold water about half-an-hour, at which time
drain this off. Put them in a porcelain-lined kettle, covering
them with boiling water, into which put a large tablespoonful
of salt. When the beans become tender, pour off the greater
portion of the water, replacing it with that which is boiling, and
when the beans become entirely tender, cut from the cob
about half the amount of corn you have of the beans, which boil
for twenty minutes; but where canned corn is used five minutes
will suffice. About five minutes before taking from the fire,
take a piece of butter about the size of an egg, worked with
sufficient flour or corn-starch to form a stiff paste. Season with
plenty of black pepper and salt to taste, adding, at the same
time, a teacupful of rich milk or cream. Then, to keep warm,
set back from the fire, not allowing to boil, but simmering
slowly. This will be equally good the next day, if kept in a
cool place, with an open cover, which prevents all danger of
souring. This is a simple, healthful, and most appetizing dish,
inexpensive and at the same time easily prepared.</p>


<h3>Saratoga Fried Potatoes.</h3>

<p>The mode of preparing the world-renowned Saratoga fried
potatoes is no longer a secret. It is as follows:</p>

<p>Peel eight good-sized potatoes; slice very thin; use slicing-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>machine,
when available, as this makes the pieces of uniform
thickness. Let them remain half-an-hour in a quart of cold
water, in which a tablespoonful of salt has been dissolved, and
lay in a sieve to drain, after which mop them over with a dry
cloth. Put a pound of lard in a spider or stewpan, and when
this is almost, but not quite, smoking hot, put in the potatoes,
stirring constantly to prevent the slices from adhering, and when
they become a light brown, dip out with a strainer ladle.</p>

<p>[If preferred, cut the potatoes in bits an inch in length, and
of the same width, treating as above.]</p>


<h3>Salsify or Oyster Plant.</h3>

<p>The best way I have yet found to cook this finely flavored
and highly delicious vegetable is: First, wash clean, but do not
remove the skin. Put the roots in more than enough boiling
water to cover them; boil until quite soft; remove the skin;
mash; add butter, and season with pepper and salt; make into
the size of oysters, and dip in thin egg batter; fry a light brown.
If the plant is first put into cold water to boil, and the skin
scraped or removed, the delicate flavor of the oyster&mdash;which
constitutes its chief merit&mdash;will be entirely dissipated and lost.</p>


<h3>Egg Plant.</h3>

<p>There is no more delicate and finely-flavored esculent to be
found in our markets than the egg plant, when cooked in the
right manner. Properly prepared, it is a most toothsome
dish; if badly cooked, it is anything but attractive. Of all the
varieties, the long purple is decidedly the best. Cut in slices,
less than one-fourth an inch in thickness; sprinkle with salt, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
let the slices lie in a colander half-an-hour or longer, to drain.
Next parboil for a few minutes, and drain off the water; season
with salt and pepper, and dip in egg batter, or beaten egg, and
fry in sweet lard mixed with a little butter, until the slices are a
light brown. Serve hot.</p>


<h3>To Boil Green Corn.</h3>

<p>Green corn should be put in hot water, with a handful of
salt, and boiled slowly for half-an-hour, or five minutes longer.
The minute the corn is done, pour off the water and let it remain
hot. All vegetables are injured by allowing them to remain
in the water after they are cooked.</p>


<h3>Boiled Rice.</h3>

<p>American rice for all its preparations is decidedly preferable,
the grain being much the largest and most nutritious. In boiling,
use two measures of water to one of rice, and let them
boil until the water is entirely evaporated. Cover tightly; set
aside, and let steam until every grain is separated. When
ready to serve, use a fork in removing the rice from the cooking
utensil.</p>

<p>[The foregoing recipe was given me by a lady of South Carolina,
of great experience in the preparation of this staple cereal
product of the Southern Atlantic seaboard.]</p>


<h3>Stewed Okra.</h3>

<p>Cut into pieces one quart of okra, and put to boil in one cup
of water; add a little onion and some tomatoes; salt and pepper
to taste; and when all is boiled tender, add a good lump
of butter, worked in with a spoonful of flour, and let stew five
minutes, stirring frequently.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

eaten hot.</p>


<h3>Icing for Cake.</h3>

<p>There are a number of formulas for the preparation of icings
for cake, but the following will invariably be found the simplest,
easiest prepared, and the best:</p>

<p>Take the whites of 4 eggs, and 1 pound of best pulverized
white sugar, and any flavoring extract most agreeable to the
taste. Break the whites of the eggs into a broad, cool dish, and
after throwing a small handful of sugar upon them, begin whipping
it in with long even strokes of the beater. Beat until the
icing is of a smooth, fine and firm texture. If not stiff enough,
put in more sugar, using at least a quarter of a pound to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
egg. Pour the icing by the spoonful on top of the cake, and
near the centre of the surface to be covered. If the loaf is so
shaped that the liquid will naturally settle to its place, it is best
left to do so. To spread it, use a broad-bladed knife, dipped in
cold water; if as thick with sugar as should be, one coat will be
amply sufficient. Leave in a moderate oven for three minutes.
To color icing yellow, use the rind of a lemon or orange, tied in
a thin muslin bag, straining a little of the juice through it and
squeezing hard into the ice and sugar; for red, use extract of
cochineal.</p>

mash thoroughly, and put in a preserving kettle, letting
them simmer slowly for fifteen or twenty minutes. Strain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
through a thin muslin bag, and, for every pint of juice, add one
pound of granulated sugar. Mix well together, and boil five
minutes, and put into glasses while warm. Cut paper to fit
the top, dip in brandy, and lay over the jelly, and when quite
cold tie a paper over the top, and put away in a dry, dark place.</p>

well beaten, the juice of 1 lemon, with half of the grated peel,
1 teaspoonful of ground cinnamon or nutmeg; boil until clear,
and strain into moulds or glasses.</p>


<h3>Ice-Cream.</h3>

<p>There are a thousand and one modes and recipes for making
ice-cream. But, after having tested the merits of a large number,
I have found the following formula, used by Mr. Piper, the
former head cook of the Occidental Hotel, of San Francisco,
in all respects superior to any that I have ever used:</p>

<p>One quart of Jersey, or best dairy milk, with the addition of
a pint of rich cream; 6 eggs, and 1 pound of best granulated
white sugar, thoroughly beaten and incorporated together; place
the milk in a can, set it in a vessel of boiling water, and let it
come to a boiling heat, stirring well at the same time. Then
take from the fire, and add vanilla, lemon, or such flavoring as
you may prefer, after which set it in ice-water to cool, and then
freeze. Break the ice for the freezer of a uniform size, mixing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
coarse salt with the mass. Stir the cream constantly, and scrape
thoroughly from the sides. The more the cream is stirred, the
more delicate the mixture will be.</p>


<h3>Orange-Ice.</h3>

<p>The juice of 6 oranges; after adding the grated rind of 1
mix the juice of two lemons, and the grated rind of one; after
adding 1 pint of granulated white sugar, dissolved in a pint of
cold water, freeze the mixture the same as ice cream.</p>


<h3>Lemon Jelly.</h3>

<p>One pound sugar; 3 lemons, sliced, and put into the sugar;
1 ounce gelatine, dissolved in cold water sufficient to cover; add
a quart of boiling water, and strain into moulds.</p>


<h3>Wine Jelly.</h3>

<p>One box Cox's gelatine, dissolved in a little warm water; add
a large goblet sherry wine, and 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pints of boiling water;
sweeten highly and boil briskly. To be eaten with cream.</p>


<h3>Peach Jelly.</h3>

<p>Do not pare, but rub your peaches; place them in a porcelain
lined kettle, with just enough water to cover. Let them
cook thoroughly&mdash;from one to two hours&mdash;then strain through
a jelly-bag. To every 4 cups of juice, add 3 cups of sugar, and
set on to boil again. Sometimes, when the fruit is particularly
fine and fresh, three-quarters of an hour or less boiling is sufficient
to make a jelly, but sometimes it takes longer. To test
it, drop some in a saucer and set on ice; if it does not spread
but remain rounded, it is done.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>


<h3>Roman Punch.</h3>

<p>Take the juice of 4 oranges, and of the same number of
lemons or limes. Dissolve 1 pound of white sugar in a pint of
water. Mix all these together, and strain; after which add 1
pint of California champagne, and 2 gills of good California
brandy, if desirable. Freeze the same as ice-cream.</p>

<h3>Butter and Butter-Making.</h3>

<p>With the exception of bread, which has been appropriately
termed "the staff of life," there is, perhaps, no other article of
food more universally used by mankind than butter. Notwithstanding
this well established fact, it is a lamentable reflection,
that really good butter is one of the rarest and most difficult
articles to be procured. Although the adulterations of this staple
article of food are numerous, the main cause of the quantities of
bad butter with which the community is burdened, is ignorance
of the true methods, and slovenliness in the preparation of this
staple article, for which no reasonable excuse can be urged. In
the making of good butter, no process is more simple or easily
accomplished. The Quakers, living in the vicinity of Philadelphia,
more than a century ago, so thoroughly understood and
practised the art of making the best butter, that the products of
their dairies sold readily in that city for from five to eight cents
per pound more than that produced by any other class.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>With these thrifty people, cleanliness was really regarded as
"akin to godliness," and the principal was thoroughly and
practically carried out in all their every day affairs. The most
scrupulous attention being paid to the keeping of all the utensils
used scrupulously clean, and so thoroughly work the mass, that
every particle of milk is expelled. The greatest evil to be
guarded against, is the too free use of salt, which for this purpose
should be of the utmost purity and refined quality. I am satisfied,
from personal observation, that the butter made at the
Jersey Farm, at San Bruno, in the vicinity of San Francisco, in
every respect equals in quality the celebrated Darlington, Philadelphia.</p>

<p>For the keeping milk fresh and sweet, and the proper setting
of the rich cream, an old style spring-house is essentially
requisite. Who that has ever visited one of these clean, cool
and inviting appendages of a well conducted farm and well
ordered household, at some home-farm of the olden time, does
not recall it in the mind's-eye, as vividly as did the poet Woodworth
when he penned that undying poem of ancient home-life,
"The Old Oaken Bucket that Hung in the Well."</p>

<p>Properly constructed, a spring-house should be built of stone,
which is regarded as the coolest&mdash;brick or concrete&mdash;with walls
at least twelve inches in thickness. The floor should be of
brick, and not more than two feet below the surface of the
ground. The roof should be of some material best adapted to
warding off the heat, and keeping the interior perfectly cool,
while due attention should be paid to the allowance of a free
circulation of air, and provision be made for thorough ventilation;
only as much light as is actually necessary should be
admitted, and where glass is used for this purpose, it should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
invariably be shielded from the sun. Walled trenches being
constructed for this purpose, a constant stream of cool running
water should pass around the pans containing the milk and
cream, which, for the making of good butter, should never be
permitted to become sour. The shelving and other furniture,
and all wooden utensils used, should be of white ash, maple or
white wood, in order to avoid all danger of communicating distasteful
or deleterious flavors. As there is no liquid more sensitive
to its surroundings, or which more readily absorbs the
flavor of articles coming in contact with it, than pure milk,
everything that has a tendency to produce this deleterious result
should be carefully excluded. Neither paints or varnish should
be used about the structure, and the entire concern should be as
utterly free from paint as the inside of an old time Quaker
meeting-house.</p>

<p>In making butter, the cream should be churned at a temperature
of about 65 degrees. When the churning is finished, take
up the lump and carefully work out every particle of milk.
Never wash or put your hands in the mass. To each pound of
butter work in a little less than an ounce of the purest dairy salt.
Set the butter away, and at the proper time work the mass over
until not a particle of milk remains.</p>


<h3>A Word of Advice to Hotel and Restaurant Cooks.</h3>

<p>I wish to say a word to the extensive brotherhood and ancient
and honorable guild constituting the Grand Army of
Hotel and Restaurant Cooks distributed throughout our country,
on the all-important subject of making coffee and heating
milk. Some satirical writer has sarcastically said that the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
to make good coffee is to ascertain how that beverage is prepared
in leading hotels and restaurants, and then make your
coffee as they don't! There is no good reason why coffee cannot
be as well made in hotel and restaurant kitchens, as in private
families or anywhere else, if the berry is good, well-browned,
and pains are taken for the proper preparation of this popular
beverage.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago the art of making coffee in large quantities,
and of properly heating milk for the same, was an unsolved
problem&mdash;in fact, if not numbered among the many lost arts,
might be classed as among the unknown in the culinary art.
Twenty-one years ago, the late Mr. Marden&mdash;a well-known
citizen of San Francisco&mdash;and the author of this work&mdash;produced,
as the result of long practical experience, a form for making a
decoction of the ancient Arabian berry, which is now in general
use throughout the entire Union. True, attempts have
been made to improve upon the mode, which was the crowning
triumph of the parties alluded to, but they have invariably
proved failures, and to-day Marden &amp; Clayton's coffee and milk
urns stand pre-eminent in this important department of cookery.
These urns are simply two capacious stone-ware jars, of
equal capacity, and made precisely alike, with an orifice one inch
from the bottom, in which a faucet is firmly cemented. Each
jar is suspended in a heavy tin casing, affording an intervening
space of two inches, which is to be filled with hot, but not boiling
water, as a too high temperature would injure the flavor of
the coffee, and detract from the aroma of the fragrant berry.
Suspend a thin cotton sack in the centre, and half the height of
the jar. After putting in this the desired amount of coffee, pour
on it sufficient boiling water to make strong coffee. As soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the water has entirely filtered through, draw off the liquid
through the stop-cock at the bottom of the jar, and return it to
the sack, passing it through, in the same manner, two or three
times. After five minutes raise the sack, pour in a cup of hot
water, and let it filter through, getting, in this manner, every
particle of the strength. Immediately after this remove the
sack; for if it is left remaining but a short time, the aroma will
be changed for the worse. Cover tightly, and keep the jar surrounded
with hot, but not boiling water. Next, put into the
milk urn&mdash;also surrounded with hot water&mdash;one-half the milk
for the amount of coffee, and at the proper time add the remaining
half of the milk, having it, in this manner, fresh, and
not over-cooked. Should the milk become too hot, pour in a
cup of cold milk, stirring well at the same time.</p>

<p>The first of these urns for making coffee and heating milk,
were those used for the purpose at the opening of the Occidental
Hotel of this city&mdash;of which Mr. Piper was at that time
the intelligent and experienced head-cook. This mode of
making coffee in large quantities is still followed at this hotel,
which, from the time of its opening to the present, has maintained
the reputation as one of the best of the numerous excellent
public houses of this city, and the entire Union.</p>


<h3>Clayton's California Golden Coffee.</h3>

<p>Let the coffee&mdash;which should be nicely browned, but not
burned&mdash;be ground rather fine, in order that you may extract
the strength without boiling&mdash;as that dissipates the aroma and
destroys the flavor. Put the coffee in a thin muslin sack&mdash;reaching
less than half-way to the bottom of the vessel&mdash;then
place it in the pot, and pour over enough boiling water to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
strong coffee. Let it stand on the hot range two or three minutes,
when lift out the sack, pour the liquid in a vessel, and return
it through the sack the second time, after which, raising
the sack again, pour through a little hot water to extract all the
strength from the grounds. Next, pour into the liquid, cold,
Jersey Dairy, or any other pure country milk, until the coffee
assumes a rich golden color, and after it reaches a boiling-heat
once more, set it back. Should the milk be boiled separately,
the richness, combined with its albumen, will be confined to
the top; whereas, if added cold, and boiled with the coffee, it
will be thoroughly incorporated with the liquid, adding materially
to its rich flavor and delicate aroma.</p>

<p>[Never substitute a woolen for the muslin strainer, as that
fabric, being animal should never come in contact with heat;
while cotton or linen, being of vegetable fibre, is easily washed
clean and dried. Neither should tin be used, as that lets the
fine coffee through, and clouds the liquid, which should be
clear. To extract its full strength, coffee should invariably be
ground as fine as oatmeal or finely-ground hominy, and protracted
boiling dissipates the aroma and destroys its fine flavor.]</p>


<h3>The Very Best Way to Make Chocolate.</h3>

<p>After grating through a coarse grater, put the chocolate in a
stewpan with a coffee-cup or more of hot water; let it boil up
two or three minutes, and add plenty of good rich country
milk to make it of the right consistency. Too much water
tends to make this otherwise delightful beverage insipid.</p>

<p>[Good Cocoa is made in the same manner.]</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>


<h3>Old Virginia Egg-Nog.</h3>

<p>Two dozen fresh eggs; 1 gallon rich milk; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pounds powdered
sugar; 2 pints cognac brandy, or Santa Cruz rum&mdash;or <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
pint cognac and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pint Jamaica, or Santa Cruz rum. Break the
eggs carefully, separating the whites from the yolks; add the
sugar to the latter, and with a strong spoon beat until very
light, adding gradually 2 dessert spoonfuls of powdered mace or
nutmeg. Next, add the liquor, pouring in slowly, stirring actively
at the same time; after which add the milk in like manner.
Meanwhile&mdash;having whipped the whites of the eggs with an egg-beater
into a light froth&mdash;pour the egg-nog into a bowl, add
the white froth, and decorate with crimson sugar or nutmeg,
and serve. The foregoing proportions will be sufficient to make
fourteen pints of very superior egg-nog.</p>


<h3>Clayton's Popular Sandwich Paste.</h3>

<p>Take 2 pounds of Whittaker's Star ham, in small pieces&mdash;<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> lean
and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> fat&mdash;the hock portion of the ham is best for this purpose.
Have ready two fresh calves tongues, boiled and skinned nicely,
and cut like the ham. Put these in a kettle, along with 2 good-sized
onions, and cover with cold water, boiling slowly until
quite tender; when add 1 pound of either fresh or canned
tomatoes, stirring for half-an-hour, adding a little hot water, if
in danger of burning. Add to the mixture, at the same time,
these spices: plenty of best mustard, and a little ground cloves,
along with Worcestershire or Challenge sauce, allowing the
mixture to simmer five minutes. When cool enough, pour
into a wooden bowl, and after chopping fine, pound the mixture
well, while it is warm, with a potato-masher. After the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
mass has cooled it will spread like butter. Should additional
seasoning be desired, it can be worked in at any desired time.
If not rich enough to suit some palates, one-fourth of a pound
best butter may be worked in.</p>

<p>The bread used for the sandwiches must be quite cold and
perfectly fresh&mdash;cutting carefully in thin slices&mdash;using for this
purpose a long, thin-bladed and quite sharp knife. Take a
thin shaving from the bottom of the loaf, then from the top an
inch-wide slice, after removing the crust. Care must be taken
to cut without either tearing or pressing the bread. Spread on
one side of each slice&mdash;as if using butter&mdash;and after joining the
slices, cut the same to suit the taste.</p>

<p>[As the best bread is the only kind to be used in making
sandwiches&mdash;without wishing to make invidious distinctions&mdash;I
must say that Engleberg furnishes from his bakery (on Kearney
street), the best I have ever used for this purpose, as it cuts
without breaking, and does not dry so soon as other breads I
have made use of.]</p>


<h3>Welsh Rabbit.</h3>

<p>To prepare Welsh rabbit, or rare-bit&mdash;both names being used
to designate this popular and appetizing dish, which has ever
been a favorite with gourmands and good livers, both ancient
and modern&mdash;take one-half pound of best cheese&mdash;not, however,
over nine months old&mdash;Davidson's, Gilroy, California, or
White's, Herkimer County, New York, and cut in small pieces.
Put over a slow fire, in a porcelain-lined kettle; when it begins
to melt pour in three tablespoonfuls rich milk or cream, and
a little good mustard. Stir from the time the cheese begins to
melt, to prevent scorching. Have ready a quite hot dish; cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the bottom with toast, buttered upon both sides, upon which
pour the melted cheese, spreading evenly over. If you prefer,
you may use as a condiment a little mustard, pepper or any
favorite sauce. This is a dish that must be eaten as soon as
taken from the fire.</p>


<h3>Delicate Waffles.</h3>

<p>Take <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pound butter; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pound fine sugar; 9 eggs; 3 pints of
milk; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ounces of best baking powder, and 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> pounds sifted
flour. Beat the butter and sugar to a cream; add the yolks of
the eggs, the milk, and half the flour; mix well, with the whites
of the eggs, beaten to a staunch snow, and add the remainder
of the flour. Bake in waffle irons, well greased and heated.
When baked, the tops may be dusted well with fine sugar, or
with a mixture of sugar and powdered cinnamon.</p>


<h3>Force-Meat Balls.</h3>

<p>Mix, with 1 pound of chopped veal, or other meat, 1 egg, a
little butter, 1 cup, or less, of bread crumbs&mdash;moistening the
whole with milk or the juice of the stewed meat. Season with
summer savory. Make into small balls, and fry brown.</p>


<h3>Beef-Tea.</h3>

<p>Take 3 pounds of lean beef; chop as fine as coarse hominy,
and put in a vessel, covering the meat with cold water. Cover
the vessel tightly, and let boil for four hours, carefully keeping
the beef just covered with the water. Pass through a colander,
pressing out all the juice with a potato-masher, strain through a
cotton cloth, and add a little salt. A glass of sherry wine decidedly
improves beef-tea.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>


<h3>Crab Sandwich.</h3>

<p>Put <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pound boiled crab meat in a mortar, and pound to a
smooth paste, adding the juice of a lemon. Season with pepper
and salt, with a pinch of curry powder, and mix the paste well
with 6 ounces best butter. Cut slices of bread rather thin, trim
off the crust, and spread.</p>


<h3>Something about Pork.&mdash;The Kind to Select, and
Best Mode of Curing.</h3>

<p>The best quality of pork, as a matter of course, is that
fed and slaughtered in the country. Corn, or any kind of
grain-fed, or, more especially, milk-fed pork, as every one
knows, who is not of the Hebrew faith, which entirely ignores
this&mdash;when properly prepared, well-flavored, oleaginous production&mdash;and
is fond of pork, from the succulent sucking pig,
the toothsome and fresh spare-rib, unrivalled as a broil, to the
broiled or boiled ham, and side-meat bacon of the full-grown
porker, is vastly superior to the meat of the slop and garbage-fed
animal raised and slaughtered in the city&mdash;more especially as
the butchering of hogs in San Francisco is at this time entirely
monopolized by the Chinese population, who seem to have a
warm side, in fact a most devoted affection, for the hog, surpassing
even that of the bog-trotters of the "Ould Sod" for the
traditional pet-pig that "ates, drinks and slapes wid the ould
man, the ould woman, and the childer." Charles Lamb's account
of the discovery of the delights of roast pig, and invention
of that luxury by the Chinaman whose bamboo hut was
burned down, in raking his pig, semi-cremated from the ashes,
burned his fingers&mdash;which, naturally clapping into his mouth to
ease the pain&mdash;which was changed to delight, causing John's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
torture-smitten visage to assume in an instant a broad grin of
satisfaction at the discovery&mdash;is undoubtedly correct, or at least
the love for the pork exhibited by the "Heathen Chinee" cannot
reasonably be accounted for in any other way. In order,
then, to get the best article of pork&mdash;wholesome, toothsome,
and, what is most important of all, entirely free from any form of
disease or taint, great care should be taken to make selections
from the small lots fed and slaughtered in the country, and
brought into the city most generally in the fall season, and which
are to be procured at the stall or shop of any reputable and reliable
dealer. Select a carcass of one hundred, or less, pounds,
with flesh hard and white, and thin skin. For salting, cut in
pieces six by eight inches, and, after having rubbed thoroughly
in salt&mdash;neither too fine nor too coarse&mdash;take a half-barrel,
sprinkle the bottom well with salt, and lay the pieces of pork in
tightly; then add salt, and follow with another layer of pork,
until the whole is packed, with salt sprinkled on top. Set in a
cool place, and, after three or four days, make a brine of boiling
water with salt&mdash;which, when cool, should be sufficiently
strong to float an egg&mdash;stir in a half pound of brown sugar,
pour over the meat sufficient to cover, and place on top a stone
heavy enough to keep the pork weighted down.</p>


<h3>Home-Made Lard.</h3>

<p>Home-made lard is undoubtedly the best as well as cheapest.
If leaf is not to be had, take 10 lbs of solid white pork, as fat as
possible, which is quite as good, if not better; cut in pieces uniformly
the size of your finger, and put in a vessel with a thick
bottom&mdash;one of iron is preferable&mdash;and adding 1 pint of water,
put on the range; keep tightly covered until the water has evap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>orated
in steam, when leave off the cover, letting it cook slowly,
until the scraps turn a light brown, when take off, and while still
quite warm, strain through a colander, pressing the scraps hard
with a potato-masher; pour the liquid into cans and set away.
The next day it will be found snow-white, solid and of a fine
and equal consistence; and for cooking purposes, quite as good
as fresh churned butter in making biscuits, any kind of pastry,
or frying eggs.</p>

<p>[In frying lard keep a careful watch and see that it does not
scorch.]</p>


<h3>New Jersey Sausage.</h3>

<p>Take the very best pork you can get&mdash;one-third fat and two-thirds
lean&mdash;and chop on a block with a kitchen cleaver.
When half chopped, season with black pepper, salt and sage,
rubbed through a sieve, and then finish the chopping; but do
not cut the meat too fine, as in that case the juice of the
meat will be lost. Make the mixture up into patties, and fry on
a common pan, placed in the oven of the stove, taking care not
to cook them hard. Veal is a good substitute for the lean pork
in making these sausages, which are much better if made one
day before cooking.</p>


<h3>Pot-Pie.</h3>

<p>The following I have found the best manner of making any
kind of pot-pie. White meat, such as chicken, quail or nice
veal, is decidedly the best for the purpose. Stew the meat until
tender, in considerable liquid as when you put into the paste
much of that will be absorbed. In making the paste take 1 quart
of flour and 2 tablespoonfuls of baking powder, rubbed well into
the flour, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> pound butter or sweet lard, and a little salt; mix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
with milk or water into a soft dough; roll <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> an inch thick; cut
to size, and lay in a steamer for 15 minutes to make light, then
put in and around the stew; cooking slowly for ten minutes.</p>


<h3>Curried Crab.</h3>

<p>Put into a saucepan <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> pound butter with a little flour; cook
together and stir till cool; then add a gill of cream, a little
cayenne pepper, salt, and a dessert-spoonful of East India Curry
Powder. Mix well together, and add 1 pound boiled crab meat,
chopped fine; stir well together&mdash;make very hot and serve. The
addition of a glass of white wine adds to the flavor of this curry.</p>


<h3>To Toast Bread.</h3>

<p>Cut bread in slices <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> an inch thick; first taking a thin crust
from top, bottom and sides, or shave the loaf before cutting&mdash;otherwise
the crust will scorch before the soft part is sufficiently
toasted.</p>


<h3>Cream Toast.</h3>

<p>To make a delicious cream toast, mix well a teaspoonful
of corn-starch with a little cold milk, and put in a stewpan with
a piece of butter the size of an egg. Pour in hot milk, and
stir two minutes, adding a little salt&mdash;a little sugar is also an
improvement&mdash;and pour over the toast while hot.</p>


<h3>Fritters.</h3>

<p>Four eggs, well beaten; 1 quart of milk; 1 quart of flour; 2
teaspoonfuls baking powder; one tablespoonful sugar, and a
little salt. Cook in best lard, and serve with hard or liquid
sauce, highly flavored with California brandy or white wine.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>


<h3>Hash.</h3>

<p>It is a mistaken idea (labored under by many), that hash can
be made of waste material, that would otherwise be thrown
away. This is a most excellent and palatable dish if properly
prepared. Take the shank, or other parts of good beef you
may have at hand, and boil, with as little water as possible,
until quite tender, and let stand until quite cold. Then take
of potatoes, that have been peeled before boiling, one-third the
amount of the meat used, and chop moderately fine, adding
plenty of pepper and salt, to taste. Next, chop two or three
onions fine, and stew them in some of the liquid in which the
meat was boiled, dredging in a little flour, and when thoroughly
done, put in the hash, and chop and mix thoroughly. If you
think the mass requires moistening add a little of the fat and
juice. Put the whole in a pan, and bake in a quick oven until
slightly browned at top and bottom.</p>

<p>Should you have good corned-beef&mdash;not too salt&mdash;it is very
nice made in this manner. Use the marrow from the bones in
making hash.</p>


<h3>Hashed Potatoes with Eggs.</h3>

<p>Chop fine 8 or 10 cold boiled potatoes; heat a pan (cast-iron
is preferable,) quite hot; put in butter the size of an egg, and as
soon as melted add the potatoes; salt and pepper; slightly stirring
frequently, and, when heated thoroughly, stir in four well-beaten
eggs. Serve on a hot dish.</p>


<h3>Baked Macaroni.</h3>

<p>Break the macaroni rather short; wash and put in salted
water; boil about twenty minutes. Drain off the water, replace
it with a cup of good milk and 1 tablespoonful of best butter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
and as soon as boiling hot put in a baking-dish. If you like
cheese, grate over it the best California article&mdash;old cheese
should never be used&mdash;and bake to a light brown.</p>

<p>For stewed macaroni omit the baking and the cheese, if you
like.</p>


<h3>Drawn-Butter.</h3>

<p>To make drawn-butter, take two tablespoonfuls of flour;
good butter, the size of an egg; a little milk, and make to a
smooth paste. Then work in slowly one-half pint of water,
until the flour is cooked. Season to taste. The foregoing
will be found a good basis for nearly all hot sauces, for fish,
beet, and other vegetables, as well as for puddings.</p>


<h3>Spiced Currants.</h3>

<p>Two boxes of currants, washed and stemmed; 3 pounds
sugar, 1 tablespoonful allspice, 1 tablespoonful of cloves, 1 tablespoonful
cinnamon; boil half-an-hour.</p>


<h3>The Best Method of Canning Fruits.</h3>

<p>There are various modes of canning fruits, almost every housekeeper
having a method of her own. For the benefit of those
who are at loss in this particular, we give the following mode&mdash;which
we fully endorse as the best within our knowledge&mdash;made
use of by Mrs. George W. Ladd, of Bradford, Massachusetts,
whose fruits, prepared in this way, have repeatedly taken
the first premium at the Agricultural Fair, held in the Old Bay
State. This lady certainly deserves the thanks of all interested
in this important matter, for her liberality in giving the public
the benefit of her knowledge and experience in this line, as
detailed in the following, published in the <i>New York Graphic</i>
of August 15, 1883:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"As the season of ripe fruit advances, I prepare such quantities
of syrup as I think I may need, in this way: Three pounds
of granulated sugar to one gallon of water and boil twenty minutes;
this I put in glass jars, when cool, and set away for future
use. Peaches, quinces, pears, apples, plums, pine apples, rhubarb,
crab apples, and, in fact, all fruits of this kind, I peel,
quarter and place in a dish of cold water (to prevent discoloration),
until I have prepared enough to fill a jar: I then pack
them solid as possible in a jar, and then fill the jar with the
syrup previously prepared. I then place a wire stand in the
bottom of my preserving kettle, on which to place the jar, then
fill the kettle with cold water until the jar is two-thirds covered;
leave the jar open, but cover the kettle and boil until the fruit
is sufficiently soft; have ready a little boiling syrup, if needed, to
fill the jar full to overflowing. Then place the rubber band
around the neck of the jar and screw the cover on as tightly as
possible; then in from three to five minutes give the cover
another turn, in order to be sure it is air tight, and you will
have no mortal trouble with it. I use Mason's jars with metallic
porcelain covers."</p>


<h3>Preparing Quinces for Canning or Preserving.</h3>

<p>Quinces for canning or preserving should be kept in a dry
place for thirty days after taking from the trees, in order to give
them richness and flavor. Peel and cut to the proper size,
carefully saving skins and cores. Put the last named in a porcelain
kettle and boil until quite tender, when strain through a
cotton-bag; afterwards put the juice back in the kettle, and add
sugar as directed in the directions for canning fruit. Boil slowly
for half-an-hour, taking off the scum as it rises, then set away to
cool, and can the fruit as directed in the receipt for canning.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>


<h3>Clayton's Monmouth Sauce.</h3>

<p>In making this delightful ketchup, take 25 pounds of fresh, or
two 8 lb. cans of tomatoes, and slice, not too thin, adding five
medium sized onions cut fine. Put these, with plenty of salt, in
a porcelain kettle; adding, with a handful of hot green peppers,
or a less quantity, if dried, 1 ounce of white ginger, chopped fine,
1 ounce of horse-radish, and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ounce each of ground cloves and
allspice, and 1 lemon, with seeds removed and cut small. After
letting these boil for three hours, work through a sieve and
return to the kettle along with a pint of wine vinegar, 2 tablespoonfuls
sugar, 2 of good mustard, a teacupful of Challenge or
Worcestershire Sauce, and let boil for 2 or 3 minutes, and set
off. To prevent fermentation, stir in a teacupful of high-proof
California brandy. If too thick, when cold reduce with vinegar.</p>


<h3>To Prepare Mustard for the Table.</h3>

<p>Take <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pound best mustard and enough wine vinegar, mixed
with <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> boiling water, 1 large teaspoonful of salt, 1 teaspoonful of
sugar, juice of half a lemon, and mix to a thin batter, and put
in a common glass jar and keep stopped tight. If pure mustard
is used, treated in this way, it will keep good for months.</p>

<p>[If you desire the best article of mustard, I think E. R.
Durkee &amp; Co's is the best I have ever used, although Colman's
ranks equally high, if you can get the genuine unadulterated
article, which can be had by procuring Crosse &amp; Blackwell's
London brand, for which Messrs. Richards and Harrison are
the San Francisco agents.]</p>


<h3>Mint Sauce.</h3>

<p>Into a teacupful of hot vinegar, in which has been dissolved
sufficient sugar to make slightly sweet, add a handful of mint
chopped quite fine. Serve hot.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>


<h3>Eggs Ought Never be Poached.</h3>

<p>Poached eggs are always tasteless, and also unhealthy, owing
to the albumen going into the water into which they are dropped,
giving it a white and milky appearance&mdash;taking away a
portion of the richness which should remain in the egg, rendering
it indigestible, and of course, unwholesome.</p>


<h3>Sunnyside Roast.</h3>

<p>Select a good, tender piece either of beef or mutton&mdash;veal and
pork can also be nicely roasted in the same way&mdash;place in your
iron saucepan or pot one tablespoonful of good lard or half as
much butter, and an onion, cut fine; let your onion fry to a light
brown, and put in your meat, first having washed, dried and
salted it. Put the cover on and let stand until it is pretty well
browned; then add water, unless in danger of burning. Add
only enough water, from time to time, to keep it from burning;
turn it frequently so that it may brown on all sides. When tender,
it will come forth brown and juicy. Just before serving, see
that there is enough water for gravy; if there is not, you can
take out the meat and add enough, but not too much, hot water,
and then pour it over the meat.</p>


<h3>Clayton's Spanish Omelette.</h3>

<p>Chop into dice <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> pound of breakfast bacon, a small tomato,
4 mushrooms, mince very fine a small onion; add pepper to
taste, put in a frying pan and cook slowly until the lean is done;
take off and put in a warm place to keep hot. This is sufficient
for 6 eggs.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>


<h3>Plain Omelette.</h3>

<p>Beat the yolks and white of 8 eggs separately until light, then
beat together; add a little salt and 1 tablespoonful cream. Have
in the pan a piece of butter, and when boiling hot pour in the
omelette and shake until it begins to stiffen; then let it brown.
Fold double and serve hot.</p>


<h3>Clam Fritters.</h3>

<p>Sift into an earthen dish 3 spoonfuls flour and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoonful
baking powder; add to this a little of the clam juice, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> a cup of
cream and 2 eggs, well beaten. Mince a pint of clams and mix
with the batter. Put 2 or 3 spoonfuls of lard into a frying-pan,
and when boiling, drop in the batter, by spoonfuls, to fry; after
frying a minute, take from the pan, drain and serve.</p>


<h3>Fried Tripe.</h3>

<p>If the tripe is boiled tender, cut in pieces 2 inches square,
season with salt and pepper and dip in a batter made of eggs,
milk and flour, and fry in sweet lard, or drippings from roast or
corned beef.</p>


<h3>Ringed Potatoes.</h3>

<p>Peel large potatoes, cut them round and round as you would
pare an apple; fry in the best lard until a light brown; sprinkle
with salt and serve hot.</p>


<h3>New Potatoes Boiled.</h3>

<p>Wash and rub new potatoes with a coarse towel, drop in boiling
water, and boil until done, taking care that they are not
over boiled. Have ready, in a saucepan, some milk or cream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
with butter, a little chopped parsley, pepper and salt; drain the
potatoes, add them to the cream with a teaspoonful of corn-starch,
soaked in a little milk; let it come to a simmer, and
serve at once.</p>


<h3>Fried Tomatoes.</h3>

<p>Take large smooth tomatoes, cut them in slices <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> an inch
thick, dip in bread crumbs or cracker dust and fry a light brown,
in half lard and half butter.</p>


<h3>Squash and Corn.&mdash;Spanish Style.</h3>

<p>Take 3 small summer squashes and 3 ears of corn; chop the
squashes and cut the corn from the cobs. Put into a saucepan
a spoonful of lard or butter, and when very hot an onion; fry a
little; add the corn and squash, 1 tomato and 1 green pepper,
cut small, and salt to taste. Cover closely and stir frequently to
prevent scorching.</p>


<h3>Pickles.</h3>

<p>To make mixed pickles, cut small cucumbers crosswise in
about 4 pieces; onions, if not very small, in 2, and peppers, if
the ordinary size, in 4 pieces. Should you have green tomatoes,
cut them small. Use a less amount of onions and peppers
than cucumbers; mix all together with a few bay leaves. Next,
take a tub or keg, and, having covered the bottom with fine salt,
put on a layer of pickles, adding alternate layers of each, leaving
that of salt on top. Cover with a cotton cloth, and lay on
a stone or wooden weight. Let them remain three days; then
take out, rinse in cold water, but do not soak, and put them in
a basket or sack to drain for twelve hours. Have ready plenty
of California wine vinegar, made hot, but not boiling, adding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the following&mdash;cloves, allspice, green ginger, and whole mustard
seed, with 1 coffee-cup sugar. When the vinegar is at
scalding heat pour over the pickles and cover.</p>


<h3>Nice Picklette.</h3>

<p>Take 4 nice cabbages, chopped fine; 1 quart onions, chopped
fine; 2 quarts&mdash;or sufficient to cover the mixture&mdash;best wine
vinegar, adding two tablespoonfuls each of ground mustard,
black pepper, cinnamon, celery salt, 1 of mace, and 1 coffee-cup
sugar. Pack the cabbages and onions in alternate layers,
with a little fine salt between, and let stand until next day; then
scald the vinegar with the spices and sugar, and pour over the
cabbages and onions. Repeat this the next day; and on the
third, heat the whole scalding hot, let it cool, and put in jars,
when it is fit for use at once.</p>


<h3>Pickled Tripe.</h3>

<p>Pickled tripe is very nice&mdash;and that sold by John Bayle, in
the California Market, which is cleaned by steam process, and
is quite tender and unsalted is a superior article. To prepare
for pickling, cut in pieces about four inches square, say five or
six pounds. Put into a kettle; cover with boiling water, adding
a handful of salt; let stand fifteen minutes; take out and
drain, keeping warm. Mix one-fourth water with the best wine
vinegar&mdash;to which add cloves, allspice and mace, with 1 teacupful
sugar; heat, and pour over the tripe, and set away to cool.
Tripe prepared in this way is the best for broiling or frying.</p>


<h3>To Cook Grouse or Prairie Chicken.</h3>

<p>The best way I have found for cooking this delicious game
bird is, first, after cleaning, to cut off the wings and legs, as,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
with the back, these parts are of little account; next, split the
birds in the centre, taking out the breast-bone, and you have
two heavy pieces; if the bird is large, divide again; do not wash,
but wipe with a damp cloth. Season with pepper and salt, and
broil with butter quite rare; then lay in a porcelain-lined pan,
with butter and currant or grape jelly, adding a little cayenne
pepper, and a small quantity of port or white wine.</p>

<p>[Venison steak may be cooked in the same manner.]</p>


<h3>Brains and Sweet-Breads.</h3>

<p>When properly prepared the brains of calves and sheep form
a very inviting dish. Lay fresh brains in cold, salted water for
fifteen minutes; then put them in boiling water, and parboil for
ten minutes. After cleaning off the outer membrane&mdash;for frying&mdash;split
them, and season with salt and pepper, and run them
through egg, beaten with a little milk; roll them in cracker-dust,
and fry to a light brown in equal parts of sweet lard and
butter.</p>

<p>For stewed brains, cut half the size for frying and put in a
stewpan, with a lump of butter, pepper and salt, a little water
or soup-stock, and one-half an onion, chopped fine and stewed
tender. Add this, and cook slowly for a few minutes, when
put in two or three spoonfuls of milk or cream, and a little
white wine or juice of lemon.</p>

<p>[Sweet-breads may be cooked in the same manner.]</p>


<h3>Stewed Spare-Ribs of Pork.</h3>

<p>Cut the ribs in pieces of a finger's length and the width of
two fingers. Put in the kettle with two onions, salt and pepper,
and cover with cold water. Let them stew slowly for two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
hours, and then put in 3 potatoes, 2 purple-top turnips,
which have been peeled and cut, and left in cold water at least
two hours; also add two tomatoes. This stew must have plenty
of gravy, which can be made by working a little flour and butter
with a few spoonfuls of rich milk, cooking five minutes.</p>

<p>[An Irish stew may be made in the foregoing manner by
substituting ribs of mutton.]</p>


<h3>Broiled Oysters.</h3>

<p>In order to broil oysters properly, take those of the largest size,
drain, and dry in a cloth, and lay carefully on a nice wire gridiron
that will hold them tight; sprinkle slightly with salt and
pepper, and put them over a good clear fire for a short time,
and turn, taking care not to broil too much; serve with the best
butter on a hot dish.</p>


<h3>Pumpkin or Squash Custard.</h3>

<p>Take enough pumpkin or squash to make 1 quart when
cooked; and after it is boiled or steamed, rub through a sieve,
and work in 3 eggs well beaten, with rich milk sufficient to
make the proper consistence, adding sugar to taste; season with
ginger and allspice, and bake in cups or dishes to a nice brown.
May be eaten hot, but is better cold.</p>


<h3>Fig Pudding.</h3>

<p>Take 1 pint grated bread crumbs, 1 cup suet, 1 cup brown
sugar, 2 eggs and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pound of fresh figs. Wash the figs in warm
water, and dry in a cloth; chop the suet and figs together, and
add the other ingredients, also 1 nutmeg, grated. Put in a
mould or floured bag, and boil 3 hours. Serve with hard sauce.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>


<h3>Fried Apples.</h3>

<p>Take 6 good cooking apples, cut in slices <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch thick;
have a pan of fresh hot lard ready, drop the slices in and fry
brown; sprinkle a little sugar over them and serve hot.</p>


<h3>Clayton's Oyster Stew.</h3>

<p>In my long experience I have found that the best way to stew
oysters, is, after having saved all the juice of the oysters, to put
it in a stew pan with a little boiling water, and a good lump of
butter worked in a little flour, adding pepper and salt. Let
these boil for two minutes, or long enough to cook the flour;
then put in the oysters, and the moment the stew boils up again
add a little sweet cream or country milk, and when it boils the
stew is cooked and should be set away from a hot fire. Cooked
in this way, good oysters will never be tough and tasteless as is
too often the case.</p>


<h3>Boiled Celery.</h3>

<p>Cut the white stalks of celery the length of asparagus, boil in
as little salted water as possible until quite tender. The
root, cut in slices, is equally good. Dress with drawn butter
made with the water in which the celery was boiled. This
vegetable is said to be a sedative and antidote to nervous
debility.</p>


<h3>Selecting Meats.</h3>

<p>For a roast of beef, select from the ribs nearest the point of
the shoulder-blade, running backward. For steaks, choose that
with the diamond bone on either side. For chops of mutton or
lamb, select the rib. For roasting, choose the loin or saddle;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
and for boiling, the leg of mutton&mdash;but not of lamb, the latter
being best roasted. For corned-beef, select parts commonly
known as the navel and plate pieces, and next best to these,
the brisket and rounds.</p>


<h3>Rebecca Jackson's Rice Pudding.</h3>

<p>Take 1 quart of rich milk; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of a coffee-cup of rice, well
washed, and a lump of butter the size of an egg, and 1 nutmeg.
This pudding must be made quite sweet, and without eggs.
Bake three hours in a moderate oven, stirring occasionally the
first hour. Bake until the top is a dark brown. To be eaten
cold.</p>

<p>[This pudding&mdash;which was a common dish in the last century&mdash;was
generally baked on Saturday for Sunday's dessert.]</p>


<h3>Bread-and-Butter Pudding.</h3>

<p>To 1 quart of milk, add 3 or 4 eggs, well beaten, with sugar
enough to make rather sweet, and season with nutmeg or cinnamon.
Put in a baking-pan and cover with slices of nice
bread, buttered on both sides. Bake until the bread is nicely
browned, taking care, however, not to bake too much, which
would make it watery. Good either hot or cold.</p>


<h3>Codfish Cakes.</h3>

<p>Pick boiled codfish in small bits, adding equal quantities of
mashed potato and fish, with two eggs, well beaten, seasoning
with black pepper, and roll in a little flour, the shape of a
small cake. Fry in sweet lard, or nice drippings, to a nice
brown, but not hard.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>


<h3>Pickled Grapes.</h3>

<p>Remove from ripe grapes all imperfect and broken berries;
line an earthen jar with grape leaves and fill with grapes. To
2 quarts vinegar add 1 pint white sugar, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ounce ground cinnamon,
and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ounce cloves. Let vinegar and spices boil five
minutes; then add the sugar, and, when moderately cool, pour
over the grapes.</p>


<h3>Forced Tomatoes.</h3>

<p>Peel and slice some large-sized tomatoes, and put in a colander
to drain. Cut in small pieces 1 pint of mushrooms, adding
some minced parsley, a slice of finely chopped ham, some
summer savory, thyme, salt, and cayenne pepper. Put all these
in a saucepan with some butter, and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup of water. Boil
together ten or fifteen minutes, and set away to cool. Have
ready some fine bread crumbs, add to them seasoning, and the
yolks of 2 or 3 well-beaten eggs. Mix the mushrooms and
tomatoes together; pour into a baking-dish a portion of it;
then sprinkle over it a layer of the bread-crumbs and add the
remainder of the tomatoes; cover with bread-crumbs, and put
some bits of butter on top. Bake half-an-hour in a well heated
oven.</p>


<h3>Broiled Flounders or Smelts.</h3>

<p>Have medium-sized flounders or smelts, cleaned with as little
cutting as possible; wash thoroughly in salted water, and dry on
a towel; mix in a saucer three tablespoonfuls of olive oil, and
1 of vinegar, with salt and pepper; score the sides of the fish at
intervals of an inch, with a sharp knife, and rub all over with
the mixture of oil, vinegar and seasoning. Place them between
the bars of a buttered gridiron, and broil a light brown
over a moderate fire.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>


<h3>Onions.</h3>

<p>There is no more healthy vegetable or article of diet in general
use than onions. Taken regularly, they greatly promote
the health of the lungs and digestive organs. Used in a cooked&mdash;either
fried, roasted or boiled&mdash;or in a raw state, their virtues
are marked and beneficial. They are among the most
popular of old-time remedies for colds, having the advantage
of always being readily procured, and it is said that affections of
the lungs and liver have been largely benefited, and even
cured, by a free use of this palatable esculent. They are also
resorted to as a sedative and remedy for sleeplessness.</p>


<h3>Singeing Fowls.</h3>

<p>The best mode I have ever followed for singeing fowls, is to
put 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of alcohol in a tin dish and light with
a match, thus making a large flame, without smoke&mdash;that is apt
to injure the flavor of the bird.</p>


<h3>The Secret of Tests of Taste and Flavor.</h3>

<p>The correct test of coffee or tea, is to make use of a thin
china or delf-ware cup, by which the lips are brought close
together, while a thicker cup would separate them widely apart.
In testing the quality and flavor of wines, the thinnest quality
of glass is for the same reason essentially requisite. Our grandmothers,
who lived a hundred years ago, understood the philosophy
of this when they expressed the opinion, that it was only
possible to get the true taste, fine flavor, and delicate aroma of
tea, by drinking it out of a china cup.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>


<h3>How to Choose Ware for Ranges.</h3>

<p>In selecting ware for a range, especial care should be taken
to see that the bottoms of all the cooking utensils are perfectly
level, for if convex, they will invariably burn in the centre. An
iron grating or gridiron&mdash;<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch in depth&mdash;placed
between the pan and the top of the range, will be found highly
useful while cooking, as this increases the heat and lessens the
liability of burning.</p>


<h3>Drying Herbs for Seasoning.</h3>

<p>All herbs should be gathered just before blossoming and dried
in the shade, or in a dark dry room, as exposure to the sun both
takes away flavor and color. When perfectly dry, put in a clean
sack and hang in a dry room or loft, and when wanted for use,
rub through a sieve. Herbs treated in this way, if left dry, will
retain their strength and remain perfectly good for years. As
long as the outer membrane of the leaves remains unbroken, the
aroma cannot escape.</p>


<h3>To Destroy Roaches, Flies and Ants.</h3>

<p>Take 15 cents worth of powdered borax and a small bottle of
Persian Insect Powder, and mix thoroughly together. In order
to use successfully, take a feather from the wing of a turkey or
goose, by the quill, and dipping the feather end in the powder,
spring the feather as a bow; in this way you can thoroughly rid
the room of flies. Before using on roaches, set the doors wide
open, as they will start for the open air; generally, however,
dying on the way. To rid cupboards or closets of ants, sprinkle
wherever these minute pests "most do congregate." An easy
and cheap remedy to rid pantries of cock-roaches is said to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
fresh cucumber parings laid in their haunts. We have never
tested this remedy, but can vouch for the efficacy of the above
mentioned compound.</p>


<h3>To Clean Tin-Ware.</h3>

<p>The best thing for cleaning tin-ware is common soda;
dampen a cloth, dip it in the soda, rub the ware briskly, after
which wipe dry.</p>


<h3>Iron Rust.</h3>

<p>Iron rust may be removed by a little salt mixed with lemon-juice;
put in the sun, and if necessary use two applications.</p>


<h3>Mildew.</h3>

<p>An old time and effectual remedy for mildew is to dip the
stained cloth in butter-milk and lay in the sun.</p>


<h3>Oysters Roasted on Chafing-Dish.</h3>

<p>Take largest oysters, and put in a chafing-dish in their own
liquor. Season with red or black pepper, adding plenty of
good butter, with a little Worcestershire sauce or walnut catsup.
After roasting&mdash;taking care not to roast too much&mdash;serve on
buttered toast.</p>


<h3>Codfish, Family Style.</h3>

<p>After the fish has been soaked twelve hours, boil slowly for
twenty-five or thirty minutes, or until it will break up nicely.
Then pick all the bones out, but do not pick the fish too fine.
Have ready three hard-boiled eggs; rub the yolks in plenty of
good butter; put into the kettle enough milk to heat the fish;
when hot stir in the butter, with the fish. At the same time
have potatoes peeled and boiled. Cut, not too small, with the
whites of the eggs cut small; season with pepper. Serve hot
with buttered toast at the bottom of the dish.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>


<h3>Codfish in Philadelphia Style.</h3>

<p>After soaking and boiling the fish, break up small, and picking
out all the bones, have ready potatoes, peeled and boiled,
equal to the amount of fish. Put them in a wooden bowl or
tray. Pound or mash well with a potato masher. Work to
soft dough, with butter and well-beaten eggs, and milk or cream.
Season with pepper and salt, if salt is required. Put it in a dish
suitable to set on the table, and bake a few minutes, or until
light brown.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
